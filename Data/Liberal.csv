The sexual misconduct isn't supposed to be targeting trans people.  It is a target for (mainly men) who would abuse the law to target women sexually in bathrooms.

Just like in the south there are laws that prohibit gatherings and protests where people are covering their faces.  This isn't a target against muslims it is a target against the KKK.

There 100% are people who believe that if you have a penis you should go into the bathroom with other people have penises and vice versa.  In the end no one is checking for dicks in the bathroom.

For example the comic Eddie Izzard.  He described himself as a lesbian trapped in a man's body.  I would bet that most women would feel uncomfortable if he was waiting in line for the women's restroom. ",Liberal,14,1493061539.0,comment

dgp8xdk,"According to quora, there are around half a million elected offices in the US. There are about a million trans people. So the rate would only have to be double for the politicians for them to match the overall numbers of trans offences. 

(This whole analysis is of course ignoring the fact that bathroom laws are frequently justified on the basis that trans people are more *likely* to offend than the average person rather than commit more offenses numerically than average people. Or else they'd be trying to ban... everyone?)

Now obviously we can't come by any figures for how many public bathroom offences committed by the whole half a million pollies but we can extrapolate on the basis of this research* showing out of 540 members of Congress and senate, there were 3 offences in the past 30 years. That means one offence per 540 people per 10 years. To change that to a commonly used sociological notation it would be roughly 200 offences per 100,000 people per year.

If trans people were to be offending at that rate, that would mean there would be around about 2000 bathroom offences by trans people in America per year - 40 in your home state if it is avg population. That is a lot.

We don't have statistics for trans offences, and even if we did I'd seriously mistrust them because:

a) a significant proportion of the population is completely stealth and no official could know they were trans

b) there is a lot of fetishists and crossdressers who aren't trans but would be included in the statistic.


However from the same article* and numerous other similar stories I've read the researchers have only dug up one case, maybe. I won't bother extrapolating from that, but I think we can all agree if there was 40 per state per year, we could find some more stories or statistics about them. (As an aside if trans people were committing crimes at that rate I think we'd have been chucked in a hole somewhere a while ago). So we can say pretty definitively that top level federal politicians are far more likely to offend statistically.

Being less quantitative, why is that? I'm just guessing here, but could it be elected politics attracted people who care about power more than morality necessarily? A high stress job that demands complete sexual conservative to match a public image might bottle things up and force them into weird criminal places. Are misogynistic/predator type personalities just more successful in party politics?

Either way I think at least some of those reasons must hold for the other 500,000 elected officers. Let's be conservative (har har) and say the rate isn't anywhere near as high... 10% would make it 20 offences per 100,000 people per year.

That still means for the 500,000 elected officials there would be around 100 bathroom offences per year. Again, no hard statistics for trans people. But do we think there are 100 assaults by trans people per year with no evidence for it? Not a single news article or Facebook hate campaign?

If you think that there is fire without smoke on trans bathroom crime, then you don't understand the way people react to us and our difference. People start campaigns against us, discriminate against us, deny us healthcare, employment and housing rights, and often drive us to suicide already. That's when we have done nothing wrong.

Imagine what they'd do if they had a legitimate reason to be frightened of us!

Edit: Post is locked but fyi I was just working it out for politicians in general, since party numbers were too hard to come by. However all of the examples of misconduct were by Republicans so the figures are even more extreme if Republicans are anything less than 100% of total politicians.

And I'm not trying to defend the laws, by the way, because for that to be true I'd have to ignore my sense that these assaults would probably happen anyway and not be prevented by that legislation.

It is a nice meme, but it would be easy for a conservative to laugh at the strawman. I have plenty of conservative friends. None of them think the trans people themselves are the point of the legislation (not that some do).",Liberal,3,1493074639.0,comment

Local elections don't work like Presidential elections. 

Especially for many of these 450,000 positions which are for rather droll or boring things, like a court aide, a town level comptroller, town financial advisers, things like that. 

Even for more interesting jobs, people often look to *experience* and *history* as the most important things in local elections. 

It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat running for some elected adviser position if you have literally no experience. 

Sure, party lines certainly will play a roll for some people, but so will experience and history will. And the lesser number of Republican voters that will only vote party line comes into play here.

2: Wartime nostalgia isn't the same as lack of knowledge of history. I think wartime nostalgia is worse than ignorance, because it romanticizes victory and the suffering of innocent people for the sake of economic gain. 

The root of the problem with the whole GOP is their fixation on winning and being right. They view life as a zero-sum game, where in order to win, others have to lose. In order for you to be right (see religion, trustworthiness of news), someone else has to be wrong. There is no room for relativism or compromise, meaning when it comes down to it, the party leaders will either realize the mistakes they have made, or turn on each other to assume the last vestiges of power they can before progressivism wins out. 

When I deal with people in my life who subscribe to this kind of winner-loser mentality, I like to engage them from a personal standpoint, because their moral/logical basis is completely broken. You need to get them to buy into the fact that suffering happens for no good reason, and that there is a better way for people to work, if only the people at the top of the power would make a few small sacrifices. You have to get them to relate to suffering on a personal level, and show clear evidence that it is not the immigrant who took their job, but a company who was willing to hire a worker for inhuman wages which took their job.

""A person or group of people who use violence and coercion to achieve a political end."" Sounds like BLM to me. As for the white shooters, if they match this definition, they are definitely terrorists too. I'm all about logical consistency.

>Maybe it wasn't about race when he hired Steve Bannon, or when he started saying America First.

I agree, I don't like Steve bannon, but he isn't a racist as from everything I've seen, just a panderer. Also, I fail to see the America First issue. I'm a free market guy, but America first doesn't imply racism.


What I see is hardcore pandering. What Trump has said is absolutely not okay, and I was calling him on it during the election. But for some people, other issues have a great weight to them personally, so they'll vote based on that.

dicqnl2,"Drumpf is a charlatan — an ignorant, incompetent, oafish, delusional, arrogant, blustering, inarticulate, uncouth, unscrupulous, hypocritical, malevolent, autocratic, thin-skinned, divisive, grossly narcissistic sociopath; a draft dodging, much sued, sexually assaulting, numerously bankrupted, pathological fabulator and liar, and a political neophyte, with an adolescent brain displaying chronic “status twitterus” (a debilitating condition in which twittering fits follow one another without recovery of consciousness between them) — in sum, a classic, “Dunning-Kruger” / “Peter Principle” affectee — utterly unfit to be POTUS. 
 
Drumpf’s sole reason for being is to feed his insatiable narcissism, and bank account. Anyone that thinks that Drumpf has ever had any sense of service other than *self*-service, or that a man who has spent his entire adult life promoting his vulgar “brand” and the many scams to which he has licensed his name — to the cost of, usually, the “poorly educated” — now cares one iota about anyone else, or that he or his familial/crony parasites will pass up any opportunity to monetize his presidency, is naïve — to the extreme. 
 
Drumpf is an ignoramus; had he not been born into great wealth it’s likely he would now be living under an overpass somewhere. Yet the poorly educated have elected this bouffanted buffoon to be POTUS, making the U.S. the laughingstock of the world. 
 
Drumpf is a man of principles few and flexible; he offers only incoherent bluster and delusionary or naively simple answers to complex problems — we will be lucky if this crétin does not cause some major tragedy to befall us. 
 
The only thing scarier than Drumpf is the ~60 million stupid people that voted for this oaf and about whom — some of them may eventually come to realize — he cares not one iota.

dianbn6,"I agree that wealth does not equate a moral or political standing, only that his choices were not people who are know for helping the small guys or people in need but rather themselves and their friends.

diapcmb,"Yeah totally agree. Your link is okay, but its has too much complaints about non essentials. Lets put aside the crap and get to the bottom line for what you get with Rich Dad, Poor Dad:

1. Already have a lot of money to buy property or other things. (high prerequisite)
2. Fix them up with money taken from a loan from the new property or to add ""property price raising things"" like driveway covers (dubious advice) or in the case of stocks and what not, ""buy low, sell high, diversify"".
3. Flip property/stocks/whatever with additional beginner sales tips.
4. Lots of motivational, probably fictional stories.
6. Be aware that owning property and big businesses gives you 'passive income' while being a professional, blue collar, or small business means you have to constantly hack at it (which is strange since both Kiyosaki and Trump have to constantly hack at it to sell RDPD)

Congratulations. I've saved you a few hundred dollars worth of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Everything else in the book is filler that has no actual long term value. Save your time with the motivational stories and just go out and do.

The real reason why Kiyosaki doesn't show his actual wealth is because he's nowhere near as rich as he claims. Your link is very clear on this. We all know this. The same reason why Trump won't show his tax returns is that we'll find out that he's nowhere near as rich as he claims. He sells and licenses his brand, but he doesn't actually own these companies. Trumps desk is a very famous example of this - it's not a real workable desk. Instead its filled with pamphlets, clips and books that he gives to people and positioned to make him seem powerful. But it's not arranged in a way that anything can actually be done. It's all show.",Liberal,6,1496277814.0,comment

You can swallow everything SNOPES tells you to believe if you want.

If you decide you want to look into it yourself you'll find in every comment section of every news, blog, Facebook post thousands of people who recall watching the clip. You'll also find the current Oprah clip cuts before the interview was finished. Someone even pulled an old news article regarding the interview where it discussed the length of the interview which is ~6 minutes short in the clip we see now including quotes from Trump you don't see in the video. 

I can't recall everything I read on it, I quickly tried to find the post which cataloged all the findings but was not able to (at work). In the end believe what you want. Ignorance is bliss.

do4l15t,"Pence was in Las Vegas, then he flew to Indiana for the game. 

The reason we know it was a cheap political stunt is that he was having a fund-raising party in California which was scheduled during the same time as the game Pence went to.

In addition, the press pool that travels with the VP was told to wait in their vans, as Pence wasn't even going to be at the game that long.

Then, after his stupid little walk-out moment, he flew back west to California for the fund-raiser.

According to the Air Force, flying a C-32, the model of plane used for Air Force 2, for one hour costs about $30,000. 

Pence’s flight from Las Vegas to Indianapolis Saturday took about three hours and 20 minutes, so it cost about $100,000. 

Pence then flew from Indianapolis to Los Angeles on Sunday, which took about four hours and 45 minutes, costing about $142,500.

The grand total: about $242,500.

The evidence we do have either clearly states the reasons (coming from both POTUS and the White House) or suggests that weather *could* have been the cause (coming from experts who have flown the type of aircraft involved or organized presidential transport for previous administrations) but it is unlikely to have been so severe as to require total cancellation. We do not have any evidence one way or the other as to the president’s actions in lieu of attending the ceremonies he missed, nor his personal motivations for missing them.

e72165x,"When Trump's casino in Atlantic City, The Castle, was failing, his father Fred bought $3.5 million in casino chips and just walked straight back out of the casino, effectively giving the casino a loan.

If Fred had given Donald a loan at the time, Donald would have had to give it straight to his creditors. Apparently he owed $3.5 billion in total, and I believe defaulted on most of it.

Condescension toward those points of view will likely yield the same outcome as in 2016. I’m moderately right and my fiancée is very left. I remember her saying before the 2016 election “I’m terrified that Trump will win this election because everyone I talk to seems to be anti Hillary or pro trump.”  I said “honey the polls say she has a 14% lead”. She says “but something doesn’t feel right about this.”  I didn’t put my finger on it then but I think I have now. There are a lot of closet right leaning people that haven’t come out.

That's because his valuation includes the wealth he accumulated via the infusion of cash by Deutsche bank.  Trump was done before that.  Well he did have the TV show and all his failing businesses.

Anyhow that criminal laundering  vaulted him into the business of international extortion and graft by way of using the full authority of the United States executive branch to manipulate markets and threaten foreign governments and businesses alike.  I wouldn't be surprised if he has a lot more money in his name now.  Well ok its invested in offshore bank accounts US authorities will never gain access to and in the name of some corporation listed with anonymous owners but still that's big bucks right there.  Or maybe Jared Kushner really is traveling across the globe meeting with world leaders and conducting business as some shadow state dept conducting such secret business no one beyond Trump and Ivanka know what he is doing all because he is so talented and smart and able to solve the world's problems?  Nah Trump isn't doing the same sort of thing his father did with him!  Just because McMaster, Tillerson, and Kelly don't know what he is doing doesn't mean he is acting as the new Michael Cohen, the new bag man!

Is it fair to judge people that lived far in the past, in a vastly different society and world, according to present fashions ? Certainly these people cannot defend themselves or their reputations. The Confederates were judged by the people of their time after the war, and this was after paying their share of a bloody and destructive war based on their views. The South was devastated in the war. Now you want to punish people some more. This is not how you justice. This is how you racist.

Slavery is wrong. Nobody is arguing that. Slavery still exists, but nobody really cares. None of the people involved in these efforts are working towards the eradication of the modern day slave trade. This is just racially charged identity politics. None of these monuments celebrate slavery or oppression. They celebrate the proud spirit of ALL Americans that stand up for their country, and stick together with their fellow citizens.

African Americans have achieved equal rights and political power. Removal of these monuments shows that. It is sad to think they re being hoodwinked into using their political power to racially divide us.

dhwvxe8,"They and many others throughout history have taken up arms against the government.

Lee was a man who was willing to fight for freedom and self determination for himself and fellow citizens. Grant did not oppose him to end slavery, the Emancipation Proclamation did that. Lincoln and Grant waged war to preserve the Union, and support the Supremacy clause of the Constitution. The United States was still in its infancy. If they could have found a way to keep slavery, and preserve the Union, there would have been no war. They tried, several times.

Do you then judge Lincoln and Grant as harshly as Lee ? They didn't own slaves, but they knew people who did. They enjoyed the benefits of slave labor. They would have never gone to war if one of the compromises would have worked. Slavery was kinda okay with them, they weren't into it themselves, but if other people were then that was their business. It was only when the States of the Confederacy declared their right to nullify Federal Law and secede to form new governments that war became inevitable.

The people and the times were different then, and it is unfair to judge them by modern norms. This is why we study history. Lee was an exceptional man in many ways. An honorable man. It is just that he was born in Virginia, not Pennsylvania. It is disrespectful to our forefathers that were there, and able to make fair judgement, and who decided to erect these monuments. They would have expected us to keep them in their memory. We have certainly been willing to accept the wonderful country they handed down to us.

I know it **""feels right""** to tear down these monuments, but you need to realize there is history and considerations you are completely ignorant of. The monuments didn't just appear.

A major reason for the EC was logistical necessity. Case in point, many states did not even hold elections in the early years, they just had the state government pick their electors:

> This is completely wrong, look up the [voting statistics for the first few presidential elections](http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present), the voting rates were abysmal, like 6-30% (of eligible voters, which were already a small group). And if you just think about it for a few minutes, you'll realize why - the country had just been created.

>> The reason the electoral college exists is specifically to prevent a large population in a small geographic area from making policies and dominating the rest of the country.

This is wrong - it confuses the great compromise (which was about the senate, and not even about rural vs urban either) with the EC. As explained:

> ""Large populations in small geographic areas"" did not even exist at the time of the constitutional convention, because it was a preindustrial era with an agrarian economy. The largest cities were Philly and Boston and they were literally multiple orders of magnitude(!) smaller than in the present. Back then, the difference in population density between some areas and others was tiny compared to the differences we see today. You cannot even guess what most founders would have thought about the urban-rural issue because it wasn't on their radar, the modern concept of the word ""urban"" *as we understand it today* didn't exist back then.

> However, don't feel too stupid because they DID indeed agree to give people in small states extra votes compared to people in large states - in the Senate. This was the ""Great Compromise"", which was opposed by most founding fathers, but was necessary to get small states on board with the idea of starting a federal government, similar to how they gave extra votes to slaveowners to get southern states on board. However, the Compromise was originally meant for just the Senate, but influenced the presidential elections indirectly in the way that electors are apportioned.

Obligatory ""just because a few of the founders believed something doesn't make it logically sound or morally just, and indeed many of them were on the wrong side of history"":

> The founding fathers themselves were quite divided on the degree to which they accepted emerging liberal philosophy of the time. Most of them were not as liberal as the philosophers on the other side of the Atlantic - they couldn't come to grips with the idea that poor people (for Alexander Hamilton) or black people (for many others) could have equal moral and political rights, since it would require them to admit that their own society was deeply flawed. Some people came up with very amusing mental gymnastics to try to justify the particular injustices that they benefited from while still painting themselves as ""freedom fighters"" against the British. And anyone who knows even an inkling of US history knows that this inconsistency was fiercely mocked by many European liberals, including the ones that otherwise supported independence.

A summary:

> Anyway, the electoral college solved multiple problems of the time as some others have pointed out already:

> 1: It simplified the logistics since actually counting the votes from all eligible voters, even though that was already a small group, would have been very hard. This is reflected in the fact that in the beginning, some states didn't even hold presidential elections - in other words elections for the electors. Instead the electors were selected by the state governments. Eventually, this gave way to the modern practice of voters actually electing the electors, like we do today.

> 2: It created an extra layer of voters between the actual voters and the presidency, to please people like Hamilton who wanted to minimize the influence of ordinary people in the government (Hamilton was far from the only founder who didn't want the poor and middle class to have equal rights, just the most famous).

> 3: It created a mechanism for vote-weighting tricks like the 3/5 and Great Compromises.

This also needs to be said:

> Also, you need to be intellectually honest and acknowledge that if you think that majorities shouldn't """"""""dominate"""""""" aka have equal voting rights, then you do not believe in republicanism or democracy or the Enlightenment values more generally that the Revolution was fought over. I bring this up because it is extremely common to see people making arguments in bad faith trying to position themselves on both sides of the argument. You can't believe two contradictory things. Either you believe in universal, inalienable, equal political rights, or you don't.

> TLDR: Rather than advantaging rural vs urban areas like you suggest, it was more to advantage the already-elected politicians in the state governments vs the voting public. As the name ""compromise"" suggests, it was openly acknowledged as being something of a betrayal to the arguments about inherent equal political rights Revolutionaries had been making a few years earlier against the British, and indeed was strongly opposed by many delegates at the convention.

> If you want a classic (ha) liberal argument for why majority rule is the only legitimate source of government, I suggest reading John Locke's [Second Treatise on Government](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm).

So far the ""important role"" the EC has played in modern America is stealing the election twice from Democrats and handing it to utter moron Republicans who trashed the country. So yeah, not really seeing any value there.

Further, right this second and because of the EC, the election is 100% driven by vote chasing in a tiny handful of ""swing states"" and ignores most of the country. Basically US presidential campaigns take place in about six to ten low population states (and Florida) because thanks to the EC the votes of the other 40 states are already locked in and nothing will be changing them.

If you're a Republican you don't campaign in California, because those EC votes are going to the Democrat no matter how much you get out the vote in California. But, take away the EC and campaigning in California might be worthwhile for a Republican Presidnetial candidate. California is a ""blue state"" only in that 61% of the population voted Democratic, if every vote counted chasing that 40% Republican vote in California might be worth it. 

Same goes for Democrats in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.

&#x200B;

Now, all that said, from a tactics standpoint, I think introducing a Constitutional Amendment to get rid of the EC probably won't work. It requires the states with no people to give up their unfair and unjust over representation and that's not going to happen. Fortunately, for people like me who think the EC is BS, there's a workaround that doesn't require a Constitutional Amendment.

Enter [nationalpopularvote.org](https://nationalpopularvote.org) Some clever people realized that it doesn't matter of the EC technically exists as long as states controlling 270 EC votes all agree to give those EC votes to the candidate who got the most votes nationwide regardless of how well that candidate did in their state. See, fun fact, the US Constitution mandates that the EC exist, but it doesn't say jack about how the states are to decide who gets the EC votes from that state. So it's 100% Constitutional.

The laws the national popular vote people are trying to get passed won't actually change how EC votes are awarded until after states with 270 or more EC's sign on, that way in the meantime the states signing up don't lose their influence. 

They've stalled out a bit, they picked up the easy states early on, and now they're struggling to get the bills passed in enough states to trigger things. But it could happen by the 2024 elections. And then the EC becomes a meaningless formality and we get a national Presidential vote where everyone's vote counts instead of our current ""fuck you, you don't live in a swing state so you're irrelevant"" system.",Liberal,21,1546606816.0,comment

edbkqy0,"Perhaps I was unclear (always possible!)

I didn't say that YOU said it's required to have a two-party system, but you implied that it is by using the phrase cartelization (cartelization implies imposed barriers to entry, which is why there tend to be oligopolies in cartelized situations.) There are requirements built into cartelized situations. Otherwise, why would there be a cartel in the first place?

My point is that even excluding any barriers to entry imposed by American political parties (and there are some, though not as many as people think), the system would tend toward two parties by virtue of being a FPTP SMD electoral system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law)). It's certainly not absolute, but even assuming a third party sprouted up, it's likely we'd still see two coalitions (left/right) to take the place of the existing big tent parties.

The point I was making was more that there is no specific cartelization going on here: it's a natural consequence of the system itself. 

You use the presidency as the example, which is fair. But that doesn't explain why pretty much every other district in American politics is effectively two party. The M + 1 calculation works pretty effectively in this case. Cartel party theory is far less explanatory for this particular outcome than the simple nature of the system itself. (Interestingly, cartel party theory has some more interesting applications in Western Europe: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/cartel-party-thesis-a-restatement/458996C30EF168AF3A13A3134AA1ACCE](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/cartel-party-thesis-a-restatement/458996C30EF168AF3A13A3134AA1ACCE) and [https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/77c01c49-8fe0-4c5f-a83e-c64362debb30.pdf](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/77c01c49-8fe0-4c5f-a83e-c64362debb30.pdf))

I'd make the case that the US is a weaker example of cartel party theory on the grounds that it was never required for the two parties to engage in such behavior: they naturally ended up there by virtue of the electoral system itself.

And if you just think about it for a few minutes, you'll realize why - the country had just been created.

> The reason the electoral college exists is specifically to prevent a large population in a small geographic area from making policies and dominating the rest of the country.

""Large populations in small geographic areas"" did not even exist at the time of the constitutional convention, because it was a preindustrial era with an agrarian economy. The largest cities were Philly and Boston and they were literally multiple orders of magnitude(!) smaller than in the present. Back then, the difference in population density between some areas and others was tiny compared to the differences we see today. You cannot even guess what most founders would have thought about the urban-rural issue because it wasn't on their radar, the modern concept of the word ""urban"" *as we understand it today* didn't exist back then.

However, don't feel too stupid because they DID indeed agree to give people in small states extra votes compared to people in large states - in the Senate. This was the ""Great Compromise"", which was opposed by most founding fathers, but was necessary to get small states on board with the idea of starting a federal government, similar to how they gave extra votes to slaveowners to get southern states on board. However, the Compromise was originally meant for just the Senate, but influenced the presidential elections indirectly in the way that electors are apportioned.

The founding fathers themselves were quite divided on the degree to which they accepted emerging liberal philosophy of the time. Most of them were not as liberal as the philosophers on the other side of the Atlantic - they couldn't come to grips with the idea that poor people (for Alexander Hamilton) or black people (for many others) could have equal moral and political rights, since it would require them to admit that their own society was deeply flawed. Some people came up with very amusing mental gymnastics to try to justify the particular injustices that they benefited from while still painting themselves as ""freedom fighters"" against the British. And anyone who knows even an inkling of US history knows that this inconsistency was fiercely mocked by many European liberals, including the ones that otherwise supported independence.

Anyway, the electoral college solved multiple problems of the time as some others have pointed out already:

1: It simplified the logistics since actually counting the votes from all eligible voters, even though that was already a small group, would have been very hard. This is reflected in the fact that in the beginning, some states didn't even hold presidential elections - in other words elections for the electors. Instead the electors were selected by the state governments. Eventually, this gave way to the modern practice of voters actually electing the electors, like we do today.

2: It created an extra layer of voters between the actual voters and the presidency, to please people like Hamilton who wanted to minimize the influence of ordinary people in the government (Hamilton was far from the only founder who didn't want the poor and middle class to have equal rights, just the most famous).

3: It created a mechanism for vote-weighting tricks like the 3/5 and Great Compromises.

Also, you need to be intellectually honest and acknowledge that if you think that majorities shouldn't """"""""dominate"""""""" aka have equal voting rights, then you do not believe in republicanism or democracy or the Enlightenment values more generally that the Revolution was fought over. I bring this up because it is extremely common to see people making arguments in bad faith trying to position themselves on both sides of the argument. You can't believe two contradictory things. Either you believe in universal, inalienable, equal political rights, or you don't.

TLDR: Rather than advantaging rural vs urban areas like you suggest, it was more to advantage the already-elected politicians in the state governments vs the voting public. As the name ""compromise"" suggests, it was openly acknowledged as being something of a betrayal to the arguments about inherent equal political rights Revolutionaries had been making a few years earlier against the British, and indeed was strongly opposed by many delegates at the convention.

If you want a classic (ha) liberal argument for why majority rule is the only legitimate source of government, I suggest reading John Locke's [Second Treatise on Government](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm).

Well yeah, most people are in cities. 

Though the second most populous state is Texas so saying New York is kind of weird. 

>Democracy is constitutionalized anarchy thats why we must mediate it appropriately.

This is what's called nonsense. Sorry, There's not a nice way of saying that but yeah, nonsense.

Democracy is any governmental system wherein people vote either for policies or representatives.

I'm going to interpret ""constitutionalized"" as meaning it has a constitution, which not all democracies have. Americans do, but the ancient Greeks did not.

Which actually brings us to anarchy, which is just the lack of a government and is by definition not a part of democracy or any government with a constitution as anarchy cannot exist within a government. It's kind of like having dry water, it doesn't make sense.

>The Electoral college is a good thing because the small states have a voice helping to mediate the influence of the mob. 

I've heard this argument a lot but it doesn't really make sense in a representative democracy (of which our constitutional republic falls within). Why? Well for starters it assumes that the will of the majority in choosing a person to represent them can be wrong. Can the person be less than their ideal? Almost 100% but if elected democratically with 1 person 1 vote the president would have to appeal to the majority of Americans.

This argument brings up a different question I've never had answered, what if the minority chose a bad president? ",Liberal,1,1546663571.0,comment

Wrong again. Democracy is a broad term that encompasses all manner of systems in which people vote on political matters. The definition you quoted to a different person explains this, though for some bizarre reason you seem to think it made a point in your favor.

>The fact that you are saying we are, on a thread that is advocating for the removal of the EC in favor of direct democracy shows you to be the unintelligent one.

Cousin, if you'd stop ranting and start learning you'd be a lot better off.

No one was talking about direct democracy, and removing the EC would not result in direct democracy. 

Direct democracy is a system of government where there are no representatives and the people vote on all matters directly, as in without representatives. If you're voting for a President you are, by definition, not involved in a direct democracy.

The term you're looking for here is ""equal representation"", meaning that all votes are counted the same, while the current EC system is unequal representation meaning that some votes are weighted so they count for more than other votes.

Both equal and unequal representation fall under the umbrella term ""democracy"", which is a really vague and stretchy term.

If you think ""republic"" and ""democracy"" are incompatible terms, or that ""republic"" implies an inherent unfairness or lack of equality in representation while democracy doesn't, then you've simply been mislead by right wing talking points.

it was designed to protect the small states from dominance by the

Daniel Schorr, gave on National Public Radio during the election crisis of 2000. It is also found in Robert Hardaway’s The Electoral College and the Constitution, which begins its discussion of the origins of the Electoral College by quoting, totally out of context,24 the statement of Delaware’s Gunning Bedford, “I do not, gentlemen, trust you.”25 The implication of Hardaway’s argument is that the electoral college was created to placate the small states.
However, in all the debates over the executive at the Constitutional Convention, this issue never came up. Indeed, the opposite argument received more attention. At one point the Convention considered allowing the state governors to choose the
president but backed away from this in part because it would allow the small states to chose one of their own.

First, you’re still conflating direct democracy with democratic, stop that. These are not the same thing. All that is required for a system to be democratic is that the populace votes. I have made this point three times now and you’ve ignored it. 

First: even if this disqualified those election from being democratic (it doesn’t, that’s a fallacy of composition), the fact that the representatives are elected democratically, the Electoral College is elected democratically, and the rest of our representatives are elected democratically, means we’re a democracy. That’s what democracy means. That the government is informed by democratic elections.

Your point about fewer people participating in other general elections is so laughably bad I don’t know where to begin. Maybe just point out that it’s an argument from popularity, and that the popularity of an election doesn’t make that election representative of the whole system. Or maybe it’s another fallacy of composition, because one election, no matter how important, can’t be reflective of the whole system. Maybe it’s just fruit from the poison tree, as your entire argument about these elections relies on a five year olds understanding of a democracy.

It doesn’t matter whether or not any of these are direct democracies for it to be democratic. Democratic only means that government is informed in some way by populace vote.

Representatives can go against their voters... but they’re still elected democratically.

The EC can vote opposite to what they were elected to vote for... but it’s members are still elected democratically.

Most people don’t vote in midterm elections... But those elections are still democratic.

Your argument stands with a poor understanding democracy, and this insistence on conflating direct democracy, with all democracy.

e5jwr6r,"Yeah i knew what you intended to mean, i was being facetious. I'm not sure you can say someone doesn't have leadership, football IQ, or experience when when they were the offense of a Super Bowl team. Sure, maybe he had reached his potential and defenses had figured out his game and could better plan for it, but that hasn't stopped Running QBs in the past (Vick, RG3, Newton, etc.).

If teams on their own don't want to sign him, that is their business. But the lawsuit implies that there were discussions between teams to prevent Kap from playing because of the negative publicity for the league. Whether or not that is true is up to the judgement of the courts that are going to view the case. 

I used Culter as an example of a shitty QB who was in the league for far longer than his skill should have allowed. I could have used any number of examples. Tebow, Sanchez, Russel, etc. I understand your point about Cutler being kept on because of an affiliation with Gase, but its tangential to the point at hand. 

Edit: you may not agree with his opinion [but here is Richard Sherman discussing QBs that are in the league that are worse than Kap](https://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/richard-sherman-listing-every-quarterback-that-is-worse-than-colin-kaepernick-by-name-is-so-mean-and-hilarious).

If BB says the sky is blue, no problem.

If BB says H. Clinton is a Satanist, there would be discussions regarding WP:BLP and WP:RS.

This is a step beyond that.  WP as a community has declared that BB is not reliable in general.  This basically swings individual discussions towards not believing BB.

“Facts” and “Truth” as reported by a new organization should always be questioned.  Even an unreliable person may have a good point once in a while and people who contribute to the project (WP), are willing to find accurate information.

That’s what people with an axe to grind or a point to make don’t understand.  You can go there to try and prove a point or shit on something but you’ll be fighting thousands of people who contribute to the project for fun.  They want it to be good and to enrich people.

And as we shall probably soon see, the ebb and flow of legal leanings may reverse course on what was permitted for a gun control law. 

A gun problem can’t be answered by laws, frankly. It is protected by the bill of rights and the protections have repeated been maintained and even sometimes extended as gun control laws are challenged. 

When Obama faced the multiple mass shootings and asked Congress to take action, He chose the fight that he could not win. He chose something that between the Republicans and the Bill of Rights, we won’t get meaningful change. He targets guns involved in mass shootings rather than the handguns involved in an overwhelming majority of gun death. 

And never mind the fact that gun violence hasn’t diminished in any statistically significant way with every gun ban in the nation. The criminals can still get guns either from the enormous pool of weapons already out there or from just going across to a state with different laws. 

It sucks because we spend all this energy on assault weapons ban when it could have been on consistency in the background check system and more resources to process background checks and prosecute those that illegally attempt to obtain firearms (we prosecute something like .1%). 

It really sucks because had mental health reforms been begun under Obama coupled with the economic strength we currently have IS shown to be the ideal solution to addressing and reducing violent crime.

As I said, there is no way to quickly screen people for mental illness with any type of accuracy.  Anyone who wasn't actively suicidal at the moment, or suffering such a debilitating illness they would preclude them from function in society would pass such an exam.  It complicates rules involving HIPAA, it's expensive, diverts resources away from useful mental healthcare and passes on additional expenses to gun owners.   

>What is your proposed solution to this problem?

To mass shootings or mental health?  

Mental healthcare needs to be more accessible and work better with insurance.  That might mean socializing healthcare to some degree so it is available to everyone.  There are more suicides that involve firearms than homicides.  If you want to address mental heath, you need to actually address it, not just tack on some bureaucratic check-boxes to the gun buying process.  

The media also needs to tone down it's coverage of mass shootings.  There is little doubt in my mind the extensive coverage of these events is inspiring other depressed/angry people from commit the next one.  ",Liberal,2,1541820593.0,comment

A good friend of mine is a practicing Psychologist in Boston.  Two sessions isn't enough time to make any conclusions about anyone high functioning.  She specifically works diagnosing children with learning disabilities, typically it takes 3-4 months of office visits and consulting with several doctors before a diagnosis is reached, and these are with cooperative patients.  

More to the point, what doctor is going to sign off on someone buying a gun after 1 or 2 visits?  The only possibility for them is liability or lawsuits.

I have a schizophrenia disorder so I know that you can pass off as healthy in front of a doctor.  But we aren't going to be able to have a perfect 100% solution to this problem.  We can certainly do more to address it.  I favor concrete ideas over generic solutions.  

By the way I know through visits to psychiatrists and support groups through the years what a dangerous and troubled person looks like.  Families that have these family members know this as well.  Some families don't want to or know how to get attention paid to their family member that needs it.  So mandatory psych evals would only help.

How about this you are guaranteed 2 visits a year and if you present any questionable behavior then you are scheduled to see the doctor more frequently.  That is how these doctor visits go normally.  That is not moving goal posts that is just talking about an internet post.  We are not talking about actual legislation right? 

This what I see as the problem.  There is prevalent gun ownership in the US and poor filtering on who can own a gun and who cannot.  Mental Health evaluations can identify people who are dangerous to society at large.  And the reality is that some people are just not equipped to own a gun and will never be in that mental state to be afforded that privilege.

dig1mkj,">~~Donald Trump~~ The Republican Party has no political philosophy beyond pissing off liberals

FTFY.

Trump just makes it more obvious, like everything else he says the soft parts loud. But the Republicans have basically been nothing more or less than the anti-Democrats since at least the 1990's.

Hell, the terrorist attack of 9/11 was successful mostly because of that. Bill Clinton thought Al Qaeda was a big deal,  the Republicans mocked him for this, remember all that ""wag the dog"" bullshit they spewed? They insisted that Al Qaeda was nothing important, and Bill's focus on it was just a pathetic attempt to distract America from the **REAL** important issue: his blowjobs.

Junior came into office with no plan or intent beyond being the anti-Clinton. Since Bill Clinton thought Al Qaeda was a big deal, Junior decided Al Qaeda was utterly irrelevant. So much so that when the CIA tried to warn him, with a memo titled ""Bin Laden determined to strike US"", he said ""Ok you've covered your ass"" and told them to stop bothering him.

So yeah, Trump has no political philosophy beyond pissing off liberals, and he defines ""liberal"" as ""anyone who disagrees with me on any topic at all"". But that's not unique to Trump, that's just Republicans. All Republicans.",Liberal,22,1496588273.0,comment

digqc8x,"I've been saying this: he's all about himself, but in a very particular way. He became a certain version of himself--a persona--for *The Apprentice.*  Then he became a different persona for his presidential bid and now as president. People keep trying to find his guiding philosophy or principles, but that's a wild goose chase; those things are moving targets, therefore they don't really exist. 

Trump-as-president is pure persona, nothing else. He does the pandering and favor-paying to keep his position (i.e., deals with Republican leadership, etc.), but  [*edit dammit! premature submit! It is a big deal! It doesn't happen to other guys!*] in those interactions *everything* we normally think of as being stable (or at least fake-to-the-public stable) is a potential bargaining chip or surprise move held in reserve or strategy piece. His ""principles,"" his ""platform,"" his ""philosophy,"" etc. don't exist; they're just assorted cards in his deck that he might or might not play or change out as necessary.

Trump-as-president is all about the persona. IMO, his persona is the embodiment of a particular kind of Republican fantasy: the leader of the ""rednecks"" (realizing that's a pretty loaded term). He does more explicitly than past presidents the things that have been Republican dog-whistle platform planks for decades. He embodies a particular right-wing fantasy:

*  *machista* masculinity, including both benevolent and outright sexism, denigration of women and anyone of nontraditional sexuality, treating women as trophies, as bodies valued only for their looks and sexual potential, etc. So his ""grab them by the pussy"" moment, publicly implying a woman would look good giving him oral sex, insulting women's looks instead of engaging with their ideas... none of that hurt him as badly as it ""should"" have, as a candidate, because his core loves it. Those are all expressions of the unspoken masculinity that many of his supporters think all men should demonstrate, and has been lost. He uses openly or implicitly gendered language to insult or belittle, and to praise. He represents ""Pittsburgh, not Paris"" (P-burg is a manly steel town in American minds, and Paris has long been a sissy effeminate whipping-boy for the Right). He praises police, armed forces, and firefighters at every turn, but refuses to even acknowledge Pride month.

* Implications of the above: assuming the superiority of jobs involving aggression and dominance (at least in the public's mind): police, soldiers, CEOs. He bemoans the dangers facing police officers but ignores forest rangers, whose jobs are much more dangerous and lethal but who do not make as good a ""macho"" image as cops. He also (suddenly, bizarrely, given his life history) seems interested in ""traditional"" marriage, and has opinions about women in the military and other gender-role-related political issues.

* Pre-civil-rights White American patriotism: US exceptionalism, Manifest Destiny, White superiority (never said *exactly* out loud... there are still some taboos in US politics, thank heavens), military hegemony, America Fuck Yeah, etc.

* Authoritarianism and dominance. His public interactions are almost never egalitarian. He has to shove people aside, crush their hands, play mind games with handshakes, start out with insults, etc. He refuses to follow White House precedents, rules, and potentially even laws. These are not, IMO, accidents; he is basically the avatar for every pissed-off white guy who thinks America was a golden land of freedom, jobs, and white male dominance until the 60s (or some other decade; it shifts). These people feel put-upon, taken advantage of, not listened to. Many of these men (and women, strangely) are from cultures that trace their roots back to European herd cultures, ""cultures of honor,"" and they feel their honor slighted every time Pelosi or Clinton opens their mouth, every time a liberal measure passes congress, every time ""traditional marriage"" is ""threatened,"" every time some imaginary past era is eroded. So he acts out their vengeance for them. He lashes out at everyone. He is the avatar of wounded white masculinity, so he never lets an insult pass. He never turns the other cheek. He attacks often, and defends even more often. He demands compliance with whatever he says, the stupider the better. He makes his lackeys lie for him, in humiliating ways. He insists on loyalty to him, personally, not to some abstract ""nation"" or ""office."" Failure to bow brings his nasty, vindictive retaliation. He is every pissed-off, wounded (really or in their imagination) white man having his comeuppance against all the people who (they think) have harmed them: liberals, uppity women, environmentalists, Europeans, etc.

* He's rich and he gets richer. He earns money coming and going, by hook and by crook, and he doesn't let anyone stop him. An army of down-on-their-luck white people lives vicariously through his excesses. They see him preaching the gospel of money erry day and winning (whether that's actually true or not). So what if he exploits the presidency to get rich? He's getting rich! And he's their guy! So it's kind of like they're getting rich. He's showing his followers that they, too, might be fabulously rich like he is, if only everyone could stick it to the intellectuals, libtards, multiculturalists, and boring bureaucrats.

There's probably more. But that's why his polling numbers aren't harmed nearly as much as they should be by things like the flat-out reality that his actions trend toward fascism, his admission of being a serial rapist, his in-our-faces corruption and graft, etc.

He's the Republican Id. He is the literal, explicit embodiment of all those things Republican politicians have been saying between the lines and by omission for decades to cynically bring in the ""white male sexist racist"" vote.

dirt2d0,"First of all, I favor a ranked voting system rather than a runoff voting system, the difference is that in a ranked voting system, you rank as many candidates as you want and if your choice has the least amount of votes, they are eliminated and your vote transfers to your second choice. This is done without a revote as you would see in a runoff system.

I think the biggest problem with a plurality system is that it spoils third party votes. Under both our current system and a plurality vote system, voting for a third party only hurts the major party that is the most ideologically similar. For example, voting for the Green Party largely just takes votes that would likely otherwise go to Democrats, therefore helping the Republicans. In a ranked voting system, a member of a third party could simply put the major party as their second choice and when it inevitably, loses, their vote is transferred to the major party. This allows for smaller parties to grow and more ideas to be heard without hurting the major parties.

Now, will this help extremists get into office? Personally, I doubt it. Let's say a moderate Libertarian is at the polls on election day deciding who to vote for. He selects Gary Johnson as his first choice but then is deciding who to put for his second choice. He is more ideologically similar to a Republican, but, being a moderate, he doesn't agree with Trump's extremist views and thus votes for Clinton. It very well could go both ways, but if Trump was elected under those circumstances, then it would truly be the people of the country to blame, not it's voting system.

I think the best example of a runoff system working is with France. Marine Le Pen did not get the plurality in the first round, but it was a lot closer than the second round, so for this example, let's pretend Le Pen had 10 more points in both rounds. If France had a regular plurality voting system, Le Pen would've won by a fairly comfortable margin, but in a runoff system, still would've lost by quite a lot.",Liberal,1,1497221696.0,comment

e0p6eog,"So, what exactly is Trump supposed to do?  Let's break it down:

1 - He can do nothing about NK, in which case he'd be in fine company alongside every President since the operational end of the Korean War.  Hasn't helped the US because we have to keep soldiers at the DMZ with the world's biggest minefield between us (this being the reason that the US was one of the few nations NOT to sign the anti-landmine treaty years ago), and it hasn't helped the Korean people because it keeps them split as a people with an existential crisis hanging over their heads.

2 - He can resume the war and attempt to change things through conflict, in which case (assuming you'd even get the authorization) you're looking at a catastrophic war in the Korean peninsula which almost certainly will spread throughout the subcontinent.  Obviously bad for BOTH sides.  I don't think anyone outside the MI Complex would have a hard-on for this option.

3 - He can attempt to do the seemingly impossible, and attempt to resolve the matter through diplomatic negotiation; in which case no matter HOW reprehensible Un is, you HAVE to go through him for that process to happen.  As a dictator, it's not like someone can go around him in the legislative process.  If NK was ruled by a nice person who was known for humanitarian actions, we wouldn't be in this situation to begin with.

I get it, really, I get it:  Trump can't do any right, and every action he makes has to be seen in the worst possible light, I hear what you're saying.  Most days I'd even agree with you, but in this particular scenario, where Trump's in a position to check off one of the Big Ticket foreign policy challenges of the modern era potentially, he's only got a couple options, and the best option forces him to begrudgingly deal with a certifiable monster.  This doesn't mean that Trump is a monster, not until he personally executes a guy with an anti-aircraft gun and causes mass-starvation.  The hyperbole makes for good press, but bad discussions.

    Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit

    President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.

    President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

    Convinced that the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognizing that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following:

    1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.

    2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.

    3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

    4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.

    Having acknowledged that the U.S.-DPRK summit — the first in history — was an epochal event of great significance in overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening up of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un commit to implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously. The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-up negotiations, led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the U.S.-DPRK summit.

    President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have committed to cooperate for the development of new U.S.-DPRK relations and for the promotion of peace, prosperity, and security of the Korean Peninsula and of the world.

    (Signed)

d9zacim,"Believe it or not, 511 is actually OK -- as long as you sample randomly from all areas of the country based on those areas' population density.

511 people is about a 95% confidence level (saying we can be 95% sure the results are accurate), a roughly 4.5 confidence interval (saying we can be pretty sure results will fall within 4.5 points of 95%) with a population size of 318 million people.

Of course, you could get stronger / even _more_ accurate results with a sample size of 1,000 or 1,500. But in statistics, you start to hit diminishing returns so that it takes a whooooole lot of effort (usually many more people polled/surveyed) to boost your accuracy by an ever-more tiny amount. So, if you're doing a poll where you don't feel you need to be iron-clad, a 511 sample size of the American population is probably OK.

Hillary may be status quo, beholden to the elites and certainly less than honest in the ways that many politicians are, but Trump is clearly a narcissist or sociopath who is interested in being president, with the accompanying power, but isn't actually that interested in doing the job. He's already said that he's going to leave most of the day-to-day work to his VP, who is basically the Christian version of the Taliban.

In addition, he has to appear in court for fraud before he takes office, he's currently embroiled in 3000+ lawsuits, he's made most of his money by screwing contractors and investors to the point where no major bank will loan him money, his campaign has been secretly in regular contact with the Russian government while that same government hacked Democrat email servers, he has very few policy positions of his own, and the ones he does have will likely be disastrous economically if they are implemented. Not only that, but his campaign has fomented racism to the point where white nationalists now feel empowered, resulting in swastikas appearing in the northeast and south. Women's groups and minorities are actively holding meetings in my area to try to figure out how to support each other during the next four years.

Under Hillary, things wouldn't have gotten a lot better but they wouldn't have gotten a lot worse, at least not very quickly. Also, the religious insanity that is now the Republican party would have been held in check by her veto power. There is nothing about Trump and a Republican congress that will do anything good for this country. They're already talking about unwinding major civil rights victories from the last eight years and depriving citizens of their newly-gained rights. They're talking about backing out of a major climate change treaty. They want to eliminate or cripple a health insurance program that has kept costs somewhat under control for the last few years while insuring 20 million people who previously had no health insurance. They're talking about eliminating Medicare.

And if you think the NSA was out of control under Obama, wait until it comes under the control of the most emotionally unstable and vindictive president ever.

Suggesting that a woman who deleted emails or was connected to Benghazi is ""as bad as"" a man who has never *ever* served his country in any way (politically or militarily), who has never helped anyone other than himself, who is openly racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, who appealed to the least educated, who surrounds himself with like minded people (same racist, uneducated, anti-science, anti-intellectual bullshit). 

Let's be honest..there was a long period of time whenever the educated people in America outnumbered the uneducated and they had the upper hand with elections. Factor in the ignorance of racism and hate and the scales have been completely tipped, unfortunately. 

The good news? Those people are dying off in droves. The average Fox News viewer age is 67 and climbing…the millennials will end up replacing the old, racist vote. 

But you're right: we live in culture where people think that google is the equivalency of a library, where dems are 'just as bad as' republicans…all of the knowledge and intellect required to discern the differences between all of these things is lost on a society of people who couldn't pass a 6th grade history/civics class. 

And no matter how much people argue, no matter how many liberals want to whine about the DNC not ""choosing"" a nominee who is a lifelong non-democrat/independent (which is exactly what the DNC was established to do…nominate the strongest democrat available…like it or not, that was Hillary), the facts won't change as they exist. 

Democrats are definitely to blame for the loss..they didn't show up in enough numbers to make a difference. The third party folks are the kid who sat behind you in Civics class who couldn't even remember to bring their textbook and was always borrowing a pencil from someone else…the truth is that America is intellectually crippled. Not because they didn't vote the way I would have liked them to but because they really are ignorant enough to not see the stark differences and how shockingly this nation is going to change as a result of a Trump presidency. 

I hope everyone is strapped in! Because we're all in the same boat and right now the captain of the ship is a dense, hateful racist who has declared bankruptcy 4 times in trying to run basic businesses who has never served his country who has ridiculed handicapped people, veterans, etc, etc, etc, etc.

The problem with allowing increasing amounts of power to be wielded by the federal government is that every now and the the voters lose their fucking minds and people like Donald Trump gain the ability to destroy the world with the powers we originally gave to someone more trustworthy.

Bernie had such a positive, issues driven message, from the beginning.  But a lot of his supporters did not.  They focused on him, as a person, instead of on his issues.

dv9hsfl,"I don’t think it’s opposition of science, from at least a “liberal” gun-nut’s point of view. The issue is that those that want to ban guns like yourself or put heavy restrictions on them don’t get that the second amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or personal defense. It has everything to do with militia use. A hunting or handgun would have very limited use these days in a militia, while the ones you’re talking about banning first are the exact models you’d want to have in that use case. 

The whole “the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed” part is quite specific and actually does make unconstitutional a lot of the restrictions we even have today. 

Performing studies to support a stance when it’s unconstitutional to perform said action seems like a waste of funds to me. There aren’t a lack of anti-gun studies out there, and nobody’s crazy to think that guns are dangerous. People get that, they aren’t all as stupid as you might want to think, but people disagree on the cost:benefit associated with the second amendment.

That’s an fantastic disagreement to have, and I think we should have a real public discussion on the exact topic.  Instead of focusing on the emotion of a tragic event that really does present a lopsided argument, we need to discuss the true costs of doing away with gun rights. Because you really would have to work a campaign to repeal the second amendment before you can legally push much further restrictions. 

From a perspective of today, removing the second amendment really removes a huge hurdle to a dictatorship / authoritarianism in the US. People somehow think that this can not be a thing, and I don’t get what they think can stop it.  A piece of paper has no meaning without power to back it up. I think the current administration and its public support is proof that “acceptable” behavior in government is shockingly far more flexible than previously thought, when it accommodates a party staying In power.  It begs the question: How far could this go? With a large majority of the military are members of said party as well and under command of a president that doesn’t subscribe to constitutional boundaries of power, my instinct tells me that it can go much further. 

Without the second amendment or restricted to only handguns and hunting rifles aren’t we just saying that we are ripe for exploitation or subjugation? ",Liberal,1,1520341151.0,comment

e3lr9sv,"That's the log on the fire problem though. They aren't defending the Second Amendment, they are trying to make the 2nd Amendment into something that it isn't by heavily changing what words and grammar mean. The right's interpretation of Constitution, like the similar pattern I found with fellow church goers, is not what's written and requires stretches in language to defend their view, not the other way around. 


There are two glaring problems, grammar, and wording. 


For example. The Army is important to safeguard our nation and should be well taken care of, they work hard and put their lives on the line for our way of life, the people deserve every right and access to healthcare, education, and the tools needed to get the job done. It's a difficult job, but I'm proud of, and support the people in every way I can, usually that's through taxes and increasing their benefits at every opportunity. 


At what point did I stop talking about people in the Army? Where did I reference civilians or anyone else that isn't in the Army specifically? Becuase that entire time I was talking about people in the Army, not factory workers or teachers. 

Now for the text.
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.


Sure times are different, but we aren't referencing everyone outside the Militia. Lefties even say that they don't mind people being armed as long as they are trained and qualified, literally what the 2nd Amendment is saying. Want to have access to military grade weapons? Join a well regulated militia, not backyard warriors, but an organized, well regulated group that is managed well. This also means people are taken care of and, I would assume, well regulated means unqualified individuals don't get to partake in militia activities. Regulated and regulations, accountability, quality, standards seem to be the nightmare for the right in every regard. 


I'm also pretty sure slave owners would prefer militia members to have access to guns, and not everyone on the street. Just saying. It doesn't matter how you slice it, Yank or Confederate, military grade weapons were an issue and everyone wanted to make sure the state, like the Army, could not come in and legally seize weapons. This as well as making sure unqualified people, people not in a well regulated militia of some sort, were not needlessly armed to start trouble. 


Person vs people.

The second issue is that we have to completely forget what these two words mean, only in this one portion of the Constitution do we have to literally forget what grammar and definitions are to change it's meaning to, ""Everyone gets access to military grade weapons no matter what."" People and person is used specifically in the Constitution constantly, and mind you these aren't 5th graders scribbling on paper, most of those involved in this drafting read and spoke multiple languages. These people weren't stupid, they wrote and argued over the Bill of Rights for good reasons.

e69j2rh,"Treason: lol no

Obstruction: at least by public info he hasn't met the criteria even though you could say he really wants to, obstruction has very specific statutory definitions, that have not been met. Potus probably cant obstruct anyways

Conspiracy: needs to have an underlying crime and nope. 

Emoluments clause: has to be a direct pay from a government, pretty unlikely. Also it's never been used so theres no precedent other than historical precedent which would be used to create the new legal precedent. Ex George Washingtons mount Vernon was extremely large and included exports, including one of the largest distilleries in north America. He certainly wasn't impeachable over his business touching foreign hands.

""Undermining x y and z"": uh we'll stick to real crimes

Telling law enforcement not to watch murderers heads when you put them in the car: not a crime 

Campaign finance: definately reporting violations but those are not really crimes, normally fines are involved such as in Obama's 2008 campaign having hundreds disclosure violations and a big fine. At least he admitting the wrong doing..

e4tieus,"It's impossible to get a complete news story today where one walks away from the giving of the facts to form one's own conclusion.  And there's a reason for that.   Before 1990, research shows that less than 49 percent of people could determine which party made a congressional speech when the source was hidden.  After that date, the number has grown to nearly 75 percent.  Why? It's because of a language approach called ""framing.""  

Framing of the news was never taught until recently. I taught newswriting, interviewing and more at two universities.   Framing links word choice with a group's most deeply held beliefs.  Given the difference between beliefs and perceptions (which lead to attitudes and opinion formation), flappable situations result.  It is the polarization we now experience. 

There was a time when all watched news together.  The use of framing has made that near impossible.  Word choices, unconsciously, excite a deep part of our beings.  

Instead, we need to return to being able to have substantive discussions, arguments on topics.  That's only possible when our language changes to the use of phrases that both sides find agreeable.  Then we move away from emotional reactions to reasoned discussion.   Until then, every time you send a meme you are not persuading, you are not changing viewpoints of anyone.  Intead, we are simply stimulating passions.  The result?  It's clear.",Liberal,5,1535218833.0,comment

First off, Fox is blatantly conservative, and they are mainstream media. And why is it there is Fox on one side, and ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, and NBC on the other. If 5 news outlets are saying one thing, and one media outlet is saying another; Im obviously going to believe the side with 5, regardless if it's Fox. I've never understood how people just strictly watch Fox. You have to broaden your horizon. I would never just watch only CNN. Although I trust CNN more than Fox, I still try to look at other news sources for all the information. I've tried just watching Fox for a week, and I can never make it because they are so blatantly unbalanced. It's almost criminal how Fox reports.

I'm sure that even in Aile's absence, Murdoch is dictating a very strict regimen of right wing white nationalist propaganda.   


Hell, on the day Manafort was found guilty and Cohen pleaded, their top story was, of course, that Mollie Tibbets killer was.....wait for it.......gasp.......an illegal immigrant.

>“Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?” he asked.

Yes, yes, yes, and no.

>New Jersey state Sen. Joe Pennacchio (R) said in a statement to the local paper that the bill should be amended to apply to gubernatorial, state Senate and Assembly candidates, too.

This, but sincerely.  I take issue with the headline that this would keep Trump off the ballot - it would keep ANY candidate off the ballot who refused to release them.  Democrat or Republican.  Trump is not being singled out, he is just the only one who has refused to conform with the unwritten rules, so now we actually have to write them down.

Conversely the few times a candidate's rights are mentioned Constitutionally are only in a restrictive sense, as in they must be over 35 and born in the US. The main question is whether the States have the power to restrict candidates appearance on the ballot for any reason other than what is explicitly outlined in the Constitution. I do believe they have the right to be more restrictive over the candidates within the States, but I doubt given the makeup of the Supreme court and the literalism of their interpretation of the Constitution and it's precendents that this would stand in Supreme Court case.

Yes, the government may be flawed, but problems can be corrected.  Greedy profiteers won't change their policies unless they're made to.

Of course they are.  They call people bigots and racists for doing nothing but acting like bigots and racists.  They're monsters!

The fact that you're putting ""victim"" in quotes, as if minority groups aren't treated like garbage, tells me quite a lot about who you are as a person.

""Are you even vaguely aware of what's going on in this country? Is every single Trump supporter the exact same way? Probably not. But there are certain ideas and ways of life that are prevalent within their communities (whether in real life or on social media.) Pretending that ""not ALL Trump supporters are like that"" is ridiculous. No, they're not all like that, but enough of them are that those ideas have taken control of their party / platforms. The problem then becomes, why aren't those that are NOT like that that are within camp Trump trying to stop those ideas from becoming a problem? The answer is that they don't give a shit. They're fine with the racism, the homophobia, the sexism, and the whacked out ideas about science and religion as long as someone that labels themselves ""Republican"" stands in a position of power. If they weren't fine with it, there would be more of a divide within the Trump supporting community, within the Republican party itself, and there isn't. That's how and why we got Trump in the first place. Open your eyes."" 

I'll also add, that being Liberal doesn't mean standing back and watching as racism, homophobia, misogyny, and the like go unchecked, because ""freedom.""  Nothing about my being liberal means that I have to stand back in silence and watch bigotry have it's way in our society.

Bullshit.  Just because Trump says something doesn't mean it's true, but then again if you haven't learned that by now you never will.  Trump has surrounded himself with bigots and homophobes (one is his vice president), who have made it their life's mission to stop gay marriage and end abortion.

Well first off [having a law degree](http://www.rasmussen.edu/student-life/blogs/main/us-presidents-with-college-educations-from-learners-to-leaders/) is important if you think about it.

Having something of a political background is important.  One does not have a to be a fixture on the wall in house of congress but having some experience there and much elsewhere is also important.

dsf4v47,"No.  Progressives came out for Hillary. She won the popular vote, but she still lost. 

The underlying problem is that the Democratic party platform is out of touch with the swing states.

Consider gun control. By every measurable metric, firearm ownership is growing rapidly. Nationally, concealed carry permitting has increased 20-fold in 20 years. In states that require them, FOID application rates are at record highs. 32 of the last 60 months have set record numbers for NICS background checks. 

And here's the important part: Most (all?) of the ""blue"" states severely restrict conceal carry and gun ownership, so they aren't seeing the concerns of these voters. 

The majority of these 15 million concealed carriers are in populous swing states. Kids who have seen mom and dad safely carry every day are now coming of voting age. Their friends and family trust them more than they trust politicians of any bent. In addition to the single-issue gun owners you had 20 years ago, you've gained another 30 million people with a vested interest in gun ownership. 

Then you have the Democratic nominee for president saying things like this:

>""We’re way out of balance. I think that we’ve got to reign in what has become an almost article of faith that anybody can have a gun anywhere, anytime. And I don’t believe that is in the best interest of the vast majority of people"" - Hillary Clinton, 2014

A direct attack on tens of millions of gun owners may help you prove your progressive credentials to progressive voters in progressive states and win you the candidacy.  But, alienating tens of millions of swing-state voters is not how you win the presidency.

She’s run television networks, magazines, written multiple best selling books, and launched a successful web platform. She’s been vocal on public policy, has had to work closely with the city of Chicago local government for decades, completely upended and helped develop an entire ghetto neighborhood into one of the most desirable places to live in Chicago, and has experience producing MASSIVE events.

Lastly, and this is no small thing - people trust her. 

She has more professional and community experience than most politicians - what’s not qualified about that? She might not have a military background, but you’d be hard pressed to argue she’s not extremely diplomatic - no one has a career like hers without having the ability to compromise and negotiate.

He's down something like 8 points since the election among REPUBLICAN voters at the moment.  He only won by the skin of his teeth last time, and demographics change is constantly working against him.  Trump's presidency is a fluke, not a harbringer.

A generic Democrat is leading Trump by 10 points at the moment, and again he is getting less and less popular as time goes on, not more so.  We should be far more worried about who we want to be president than who we think can win.  Outside of that if anything Winfrey is likely to do worse than a generic Democrat.  She's not progressive enough to win over the Jill Stein crowd and she's to close much to Trump to win over any Republicans worried about Trump's competence.  

At this point I'd be willing to wager the the average high school drop out has greater intellect than Trump at this point.  That doesn't mean I want to elect one president.  Running any business and running a government are not complimentary skills (as much as Republicans would like us all to believe otherwise).  Just look at Tillerson at State, and Exxon is a much larger organization that deals directly with foreign governments as a matter of course.

dsgt79u,">I like how you bring up gun control issues but ignore both the NRA lobby control over the GOP

You've got it backwards. The GOP controls the NRA. This is evidenced by the GOP's complete lack of giving a crap about gun issues any time other than during election season. It is further evidenced by the GOP's ability to win NRA endorsement of Mitt Romney, John McCain, and Donald Trump, all of whom were well on the opposite side of the issue before their presidential runs.   

>and the reality of increasing mass shootings. 

Which are not being committed by the 15 million licensees who have to decide whether to elect the person blaming them for gun problems, or their opponent.  Focusing on mass shootings loses far more Democratic votes than it gains. 

Democrats running on gun control in the swing states are like Republicans preaching their opposition to net neutrality on Reddit. You will lose far more support than you will gain. 

>Having said that, gun rights issues are just one issue among many other issues.

Yes, certainly. But don't underestimate the growing importance. Again, 15 million licensed concealed carriers, virtually all of whom are in the swing states. 20 years ago, this voting bloc was fewer than 1 million. The friends and family of these concealed carriers add at least another 15 million, and the kids of the first carriers are now coming of age and are being gifted their first handguns by their concealed carrier parents. 

This is one issue that Democrats cannot afford to be on the wrong side of, and the ""wrong side"" is the position popular in democratic enclaves. 

We need the swing states far more than we need gun control. Abandoning 15 million concealed carriers to the GOP is political suicide. ",Liberal,1,1515591513.0,comment

dx5ce7v,"I think I see why people are down voting and I think it’s just a misunderstanding. Freedom of speech is specifically referring to liberty. Hence the name *freedom* of speech.

It’s a pretty easy thing to overlook when you don’t think of the moniker itself.

So, freedom of speech is a right that people give themselves and cannot be infringed upon by any government. A person is allowed to say, “I hate Jews.” But they might not be allowed to say that on my television show or podcast or Facebook page, as a person which is my right to my platform. So when I decide to censor it, it’s not infringing on freedom of speech. I assert the same logic applies to people deciding to protest speech they do not approve of by boycott in the most meaningful way to the individual the intended message was directed toward.

Anyways, hopefully you understand my meaning.

dx7058z,"Modern conservatism has shifted since the 60s.

It used to be that southern democrats were pro-labor and against big business because the south’s economy relied on farming. But that doesn’t mean that they were socially liberal.

“The monopoly that the Democratic Party held over most of the South first showed major signs of breaking apart in 1948, when many Southern Democrats, dissatisfied with the policies of desegregation enacted during the administration of Democratic President Harry Truman, created the States Rights Democratic Party, which nominated South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond for president and Mississippi Governor Fielding L. Wright for vice president. The “Dixiecrats” managed to win many Southern states, but collapsed as a party soon after the election, with effectively all members returning to the Democratic Party. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat from the Southern state of Texas, led many Southern Democrats to vote for Barry Goldwater at the national level. In the ensuing years, the increasing conservatism of the Republican Party compared to the liberalism of the Democratic Party (especially on social and cultural issues) led many more conservative white Democrats in the South to vote Republican. However, many continued to vote for Democrats at the state and local levels ,especially before 1994. After 2010, Republicans had gained a solid advantage over Democrats at all levels of politics in most Southern states.”

I don't see where you are going with this.  In most states you can own a light machine gun, the background check is the same standard as to buy any other firearm.

I would bet you my bottom dollar that most criminals in the US buy (at least most of) their magazines and ammo legally. The issue of 3D-printed weapons is currently a side-issue because it's *currently* easier to buy an illegal gun then to buy a 3D printer or a dedicated ghost gun mill. But that's beside the point. If there were better enforcement of illegal gun sales and less illegal guns out there, it would be an issue. 

It wouldn't make it harder for people to buy gun parts legally, it could be as simple as entering a license number and having the name on the credit card match.


>I agree. We need a system that protects everyone's privacy though. I shouldn't be able to just order a background check on my neighbors because I'm nosy. This is a non-trivial problem if you want to close the ""gun show loophole""

That's why we need a licensing system rather than an instant cursory criminal record check, which you already CAN run on anyone you want to if you pay the money.

>I don't see where you are going with this. In most states you can own a light machine gun, the background check is the same standard as to buy any other firearm.

Like with most NFA items, they don't get used in crimes because people like me who own them aren't criminals.

1. Machine guns are regulated because they're dangerous.
2. Machine guns aren't regularly used in crimes because they're heavily regulated.
3. AR-15s are dangerous, albeit to a lesser extent
4. AR-15s are used in more crimes than legal machine guns because they are barely regulated.
5. More heavy regulation of AR-15s would see them used in less crimes.

Whether or not guns are used in ""many"" crimes (a relative term) has no baring on whether or not they should be regulated. Nuclear weapons are used in few (zero) crimes, but you can bet your ass that the FBI is going to kick your door down if you try to ""exercise your rights"" in your garage.

The fact is that a weapon's deadliness determines whether it should be regulated, not whether it is used in a lot of crimes.

Also, the comparison of the damage a light machine gun could do versus some kid's plinkgun gun is laughable. Imagine the Las Vegas shooting if he had managed to get an M60 or an M240 like he apparently was trying to, instead of AR-15s with bump stocks. Easily three times the causalities.

I disagree.  Most gun crime is committed by people who are prohibited from owning firearms.  It is still a felony is all 50 states for prohibited people to purchase ammo, regardless if there is a background check.  It's impossible for them to purchase ammo legally.

>That's why we need a licensing system rather than an instant cursory criminal record check, which you already CAN run on anyone you want to if you pay the money.

I don't agree that you should need or maintain a license to exercise a constitutionally protected right.  Can you imagine someone seriously suggesting people get licenses to vote?  Republicans can.

Do you have evidence to support this?  The shooter was not a prohibited person and had the type of money to be able to afford a machine gun.  He also lived in a state where it would be legal for him to do so.  This is the first I've heard he had attempted to purchase machine guns and was prevented.

e65e0p5,"This. THIS...

If you think that the political discourse in America is anything other than the white Evangelicals hell bent on erecting a Christian theocracy you’re wrong. 

The American Evangelicals didn’t elect Trump because of his Christian values...the elected him because he’s an autocratic authoritarian as a leader. THIS is their favorite quality about him.  

They need that type of leader to force the implementation of ultimately what Evangelicals want...Christian theocratic rule. So they don’t care what Trump did or who he is as long as he puts theocratic judges in those seats. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that’s why they surround the Republican Party...it’s the party of “God”. 

The Supreme Court picks are more important than Trump. Ultimately, this is what they’re after. Trump is the tool, the way to get those judges into power. 

You see, conservatives have to deal with the pesky Bill of Rights and Constitution and ultimately it’s the SCOTUS that determines if it’s unconstitutional. Once they have theological justices appointed they can overrule congress and even the states and claim things like abortions and gay marriage as unconstitutional.  

And that’s just the start...

They will implement public prayer in courts, in schools and houses of governance, they will expand laws, loosen the death penalty, overrule on local cases such as sexual or racial discrimination etc. 

THIS is what they mean by Make America Great AGAIN, they want to take it back...way back. Possibly to the dark ages where churches and courts are one in the same. 

We will be like Iran in the 70s or Afghanistan. The only problem they have with the Taliban is that they are Muslim. They think having Christian police enforcing biblical law would be exactly what we need in America.

Edit: I want to iterate that I completely support religious freedom in America. I fully support the freedom of religion and freedom FROM religion and the government  not respecting the establishment of a national religion, I do not support the suppression of religious practices or symbols.

> The Confederate sees a divinely ordained way things are supposed to be, and defends it at all costs. No process, no matter how orderly or democratic, can justify fundamental change.


> When in the majority, Confederates protect the established order through democracy. If they are not in the majority, but have power, they protect it through the authority of law. If the law is against them, but they have social standing, they create shams of law, which are kept in place through the power of social disapproval. If disapproval is not enough, they keep the wrong people from claiming their legal rights by the threat of ostracism and economic retribution. If that is not intimidating enough, there are physical threats, then beatings and fires, and, if that fails, murder.

It just so happens that church is a central part of southern life and a lot of anti-civil rights activism took place through the white Baptist churches.  Because the group of people that attended (and still attend) those churches are also the same people who wanted to keep racism as an institution in America, I think the term evangelical just kind of stuck.

It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything”—there’s a long line of allegations against Trump. Jill Harth says Trump assaulted her in the 1990s. Trump’s ex-wife Ivana Trump once suggested he had raped her, though she has since recanted her story. Former Miss Utah Temple Taggart said he kissed her on the lips inappropriately. But since the release, more women have come forward. Two told The New York Times that Trump had assaulted them, one saying he tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight in the 1970s and another saying he forcibly kissed her. A Florida woman says Trump groped her. A former People reporter recounted an alleged assault at his Mar-a-Lago debate, and says he told her, “You know we’re going to have an affair, don’t you?” Several former teen pageant contestants said Trump walked in on them while they were naked or partially dressed.
