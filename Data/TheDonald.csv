dzb6t9t,"I hate her so much

*Edit*: im not talking about Donald Glover, talking about Nicole Arbor who made a ‘[Female Edit](https://youtu.be/QW8whgmyTNU)’ version of this song that was just complete shit.

She’s also the same person who mad the ‘[Dear Fat People](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154221907732907&id=6863782906&_rdr)’ video where she says basically “*Hey fat people, just stop eating so much and you’ll be healthy again*”

She’s also the same person who made a video about [depression](https://youtu.be/YAAoVpP3BQM) basically saying “*Youre depressed? Aww well that sucks, but guess what? It’s all in your head! Just be happy! Think happy and you’ll be better! You’re not depressed you’re just faking it!*”

She’s also the same person who beat her now ex-boyfriend Mathew Santoro and was a [really](https://youtu.be/B5LlpqU3YpI) [abusive](https://youtu.be/DcSakYIP2W4) [and](https://youtu.be/CH63dTDH-jE) [controlling](https://youtu.be/_0Ho2uLfKxo) [girlfriend](https://youtu.be/JJY7Bx-0Dlw).


I hope everyone knows [this](https://youtu.be/LnDRuhC8o2c), downvote me all you want but I’m not taking [this](https://youtu.be/G3Rik0FEVe0) down so people can understand at least why I said that I [really](https://youtu.be/vdiNwylLGH4) [hate](https://youtu.be/bCgsrOtCBXM) [her](https://youtu.be/zFEOXQl2Zj4) (Her being Nicole Arbor)

####Edit

Also, I also want to say that she advocates sluttiness, then doesn’t back and forth. She made a few videos about being a [Slutty Claus](https://youtu.be/HgVCArO5eTo) and a video of her being [naked on a youtube video](https://youtu.be/6whEGP1EuXk)

#Conclusion

If you still dislike me or downvote me (mainly because I was too vague when I said “*I hate her*”) then I’m sorry, if you see why I said I hate her,
Thank you for understanding.",thedonald,-8,1526865522.0,comment

dzb866a,"**Paradox of tolerance**

The paradox of tolerance was described by Karl Popper in 1945. The paradox states that if a society is tolerant without limit, their ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

e2thzsj,"I saw Donald Glover at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him laugh as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like ten Twirls in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",thedonald,-9,1532238157.0,comment

Assuming this isn't an alt and you actually have only been a redditor for 4 months, you have to know that there was a time that that sub was front of r/all constantly. Like I remember like top 5 or top 7 were all from that sub. Anytime you went to r/all that sub would be there and pretty much always it would be multiple posts at that. 

It was seriously a dark time for reddit. Most redditors remember that and that's probably why they downvoted you - not for the not wanting an anti trump subreddit. If you had just said that part you might have been the top 5 comment on this post.

Edit: Oh it was worse than that. Here's an article and screenshot about it. I remember going to reddit on my phone that day it was insane. But it wasn't uncommon on other days ti have 3-4 top first page posts be from that sub. I believe r/popular was made for THAT sub mainly and the rest of the political subs 2nd.

- A pedantic but hilarious point: I'm not subbed to r/vegan. I'm not subbed anywhere, I prefer to visit particular subs I like when I feel like it instead if making a home page. If you're gonna be a self righteous prick with one insulting sentence, at least make it a true sentence.

- Bringing up where people post other than the present conversation is pretty immature. I don't even care if somebody posts primarily in some furry porn sub or pagan rituals sub or something, it has nothing to do with the conversation at hand.

- What's wrong with being vegan? You don't like it when others refuse to consume products which harm animals? It's not even some extremist thing. Lots of people are vegan, it's growing at an exponential rate. r/vegan is amung the fastest consistently growing subs on Reddit, gaining a thousand new subs every couple days.

e2thrnv,"Not at all.  Originally ~2012 Reddit was all about Ron Paul and smothered the website with his campaign.  After that election Reddit turned to Bernie Sanders and did whatever it could to keep pro-Sanders content on the front page, including obnoxious ""MATCH ME"" threads and anything else from SandersForPresident.  Around the time Trump started to be accepted as the Republican nominee and Sanders had a terrible Super Tuesday where the race was pretty much over for him, users aggregated to T_D which was a parody of SandersForPresident.  Pro-Trump content, ""don't need to match me"" posts, the whole nine yards.  

It really wasn't until admins admitted ""we are going to change the algorithm for front page posts because of T_D"" that T_D really started to come to its own as we know it today.  After that the Trump AMA happened and was off the front page in about 5 minutes because of the restrictions put on T_D specifically.  Then the admins edited posts without the user's knowledge.  Then the admins changed the algorithm again.  Then the admins put more restrictions on T_D.

Basically, the admins screwed this up since near the beginning but it was Reddit that started it all with how obnoxious it was about Paul and later Sanders.

EDIT: If you all want to downvote history, go ahead, but there is absolutely no chance T_D was made as a satire of Trump.  That's just a fact.",thedonald,-5,1532237787.0,comment

e2t96ct,"The US justice system targets minorities over white people. 


  


Despite white people being on par of committing crime when it comes to comparing by race (or they own the lion's share in most cases), black people are 6 times more likely to be incarcerated.

  


Five times as many white people are using drugs as black people, yet black people are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of white people. Black people represent 12% of the total population of drug users, but 38% of those arrested for drug offenses, and 59% of those in state prison for a drug offense. Black people serve virtually as much time in prison for a drug offense (58.7 months) as white people do for a violent offense (61.7 months).

  


If black people and Hispanics were incarcerated at the rate of white people, the prison population would drop 50%, which would reflect that white people commit the most crime in any category and would be the largest prison population in America.

e2tb2uo,"If, at a fundamental level, somebody disagrees with the founding principles of human society and ethics - sure that is a valid opinion to have. If somebody believes that suffering is good and their goal is to harm as many other people as possible I can't think of a sound logical argument why that is wrong, and I would accept that while it's not my opinion it's a fine thing to think.

The problem is, political opinions come with the concept of pre-recognized structures of social agreement about the form and function of government. If the goal of government is to, ideally, secure the maximum freedom, happiness, and fulfillment of it's people then it is pretty easy to discount many ""opinions"" as incompatible with that mission statement and therefore politically unrespectable.

They are led by people who can be corrupt and totally immoral. There can be terrorists of every faith. Political upheaval can be due to a lot more than just religious divides.

dzbfay8,"I am by no means an expert on Donald, I only really started following him because I liked Camp a lot, and then really loved Community. Idk Derrick at all, and have only heard one of his more recent stand ups on Spotify. But around the time that Because The Internet came out I think it was pretty apparent that Donald was re\-thinking a lot of things. It was around this time \(I believe\) that he left Community, and I think a lot of it was that he was worried to get typecast as a goofy idiot character like Troy for the rest of his career, and he wanted more having already written for 30 Rock and attending NYU. In 2013 around the time of Because the Internet he also posted a monologue thing on his Instagram expressing doubts and frustrations \([https://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/donald\-glover\-pens\-candid\-personal\-notes\-in\-a\-hotel\-room?utm\_term=.xb49PRbPm#.oc0noZJoj](https://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/donald-glover-pens-candid-personal-notes-in-a-hotel-room?utm_term=.xb49PRbPm#.oc0noZJoj)\) hopefully the link works. So what I'm driving at is I think it's impossible to say if Donald is putting all of this on or not without really knowing him, but it does seem genuine. I think the drive to being a more nuanced and complex performer was apparent throughout the aspects of his career. I think BTI and Awaken, My Love were his attempts to move towards a style truer to his growing ideals. He wasn't a goofy kid just rapping for fun anymore. I also think how private he seeks to keep his personal life also hints at him being more genuine than just doing a cash grab.

TL;DR: I think the transition is a pretty genuine reflection of his personal growth, but I am by no means an expert and have no idea if it is precedented elsewhere. ",thedonald,175,1526875867.0,comment
dzbgdh8,"This is a very interesting article, if you have the time to read it: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you

Some excerpts: 


>  He picked up a rock from the fire pit, then dropped it. “It’s hot! I didn’t know it was the same rock.” Looking at his singed fingers, he said, “Chris Rock told me, ‘Man, they wouldn’t have let me make your show back in the day.’ I’m a little better than Chris, because I had Chris to study. And now I am actively looking for the black female to replace me.” Robinson studied him over the flames. “I’m going to die someday, I hope. Then I won’t have all this pain and anguish and pressure. And someone better will replace me. If God exists, all she really wants is a conversation.”

—

> Glover positioned his straw hat, poised for departure. “In another universe,” he said, “there might be a doppelgänger Donald who wears a cowboy hat. But I’ve decided to experience the loop in this form. It’s a very complex level of energy compared to a giraffe, or a metal alloy. I do think I’ll go back to a stasis state at some point, and it might not be that long from now.” He went on, reassuringly, “I wouldn’t want anyone to feel bad. It’ll be like I was at a big party, and everyone’s enjoying themselves, wandering around—and suddenly you all start going, ‘Where’s Donald?’ ” He acted out the concerned partygoers: “ ‘Where’d he go?’ ‘I saw him, I talked to him!’ ‘He was just here a little while ago!’ ” And then the collective shrug: “ ‘Oh, well, I guess he slipped out.’ ”

dzbrky3,"He's an entertainer. They have like 10 different personalities at any given time. He's an actor, which means he knows how to play up different personas convincingly. He's a singer/rapper who blends genres so that covers even more bases. And he's a talented writer/director so he knows how to create situations/dialogues too.

It's called being creative/multi-talented, it's not really anything to worry about or be wary of lol. I guess in the era of ""famous for being famous"" it becomes weirdly intimidating or confusing when someone actually gives you multiple/diverse interesting works of art in exchange for the fandom.

edit: Also I think to some extent, coming in through safe comedy was probably a way of safely going mainstream first so he had the space, financial means and fanbase to eventually be able do whatever he wanted later. Hence being in a Star Wars film while releasing a strongly political trap anthem and directing a tv series he calls ""the black Twin Peaks"".

dzbnsp3,"**Clan Donald**

Clan Donald, also known as Clan MacDonald (Scottish Gaelic: Clann Dòmhnaill [ˈkʰl̪ˠãũn̪ˠ ˈdõː.ɪʎ]), is a Highland Scottish clan and one of the largest Scottish clans. The Lord Lyon King of Arms who is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in that country, issuing new grants of coats of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, recognizes under Scottish law the High Chief of Clan Donald. Historically the chiefs of the Clan Donald held the title of Lord of the Isles until 1493 and two of those chiefs also held the title of Earl of Ross until 1476.

There are also numerous branches to the Clan Donald and several of these have chiefs recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms; these are: Clan Macdonald of Sleat, Clan Macdonald of Clanranald, Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, and Clan MacAlister.

I'll have to listen to the song a few more times.  The video was interesting.  Song didn't do much for me, but I was slightly distracted.  Obviously it's a lot more meaningful than some chick being overtly sexual while sporting a stupid haircut.  Just not 100% sold yet that in my personal opinion it's all that powerful, to me at least.  That's the thing about something artistic though, not everyone is going to like it or ""get it"".  If I fall into those categories that doesn't mean I don't appreciate it for moving others.  It's obviously moved quite a few people, it's clearly not delusional artist nonsense.

dzbjyxs,"My personal take is that, amongst other threads, he's taking us on a museum like tour of his own career, set against the context of all the turmoil America has experienced during that time. He's commenting on angst over his own sense of responsibility as an artist-especially a black one-in modern day America. Main reason being that he'sactually the one pulling the trigger, and not just happening upon the scene. 

We dont know if we're watching Donald, Gambino, or one of the many other characters he's played, and that's central to his angst. All that tongue in cheek stuff about ""I'm so pretty, watch me move"" while everything is burning seems like meta criticism to me. 

The black choir is celebrating him making it big and getting his money, but after he dances out happily, he stops and someone out of frame throws him a gun. He looks despondent yet does his job and moves on. Later, the incarcerated man plays guitar, the ""get your money black man"" comes back but in a different tone, a voice says pretty aggressively ""get down"" and as he dances in response, the camera slowly pans out to reveal the extent of what happened while we're watching him

Early in his career, in the DerrickComedy days, he was very unfairly criticized as an oreo or for not being more outspoken in his art. When he first started making music, he was considered bubblegum, and some in the black community treated him like a Macklemore, using the hip hop form without paying dues to its history and purpose. That last frame of him being chased by what looks like a large crowd of white fans seems to me like a depiction of what happens to those kinds of artists when they ""go black""",thedonald,2,1526883691.0,comment

Lol this is such bullshit. First off, he wasn't mimicking them, he actually used the artists adlibs. Hence why they are credited on the song as providing vocals. 
https://listen.tidal.com/album/88432758 or check wikipedia. he didnt mimic anyone.

Second, Gambino loves trap music, especially migos, he shouted them out when Atlanta won an award and they were in an episode of the show. He also has a trap inspired mixtape.

Third, it has already been explained why the adlibs were there http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/05/childish-gambino-we-are-the-world-with-this-is-america/

2pac knew what people thought of him and didn't care, therefore he caught a lot of flack for that.  He dressed and promoted black culture and was a fore runner of style for it, but he always said stop the black on black violence.

If you take those adlibs into the context of the whole song it wouldn’t be a stretch to read into those adlibs as him clowning on those guys. And I'm okay with it being like that because you end up with songs like Mt Olympus from Krit when he responded to control.

Also, only a few of those rappers were from Atlanta far from all of them, once again showing off your vast Hip-Hop knowledge. And yes it wasn't Gambino that said it but it was the co-producer, thats about as close as you'll get.

Now I feel like the message is too spread out not concise and it has erred the momentum that was being gained.

It made what he said, more true IMO, and it more so came across as he was sick to death of it, but would still preach change, while now it has just become something the states just have to deal with.

dzdippf,"> Now I feel like the message is too spread out not concise and it has erred the momentum that was being gained.

The Civil Rights movement worked because it had a leader in MLK. BLM does not have a leader to coalesce around and solidify their position which means their rhetoric is largely ineffective and at times contradictory. The same thing happened with Occupy Wall Street. They had the support of the people, or at least a good chunk of them, but no single goal to focus that many people or a leader to herd them along.


> while now it has just become something the states just have to deal with

This is not an accident by any means. The disenfranchised are found everywhere. On a national scale they have a real voice. But if you break them up into 50 pieces their voice becomes muted. State's Rights is the biggest dog whistle in American history. ",thedonald,1,1526971781.0,comment

He's a failure who spend over 100 million simply on golfing!!! Obama lowered gas prices and stabilized the economy! Trump is destabilizing the economy and gas prices are on the rise! Obama made Putin fear us yet trump has Putin's cock in his mouth and is terrified to say anything mean to his master! Obama made America great plain and simple and I've yet to find a Trumper that can say otherwise! Obama introduced an amazing healthcare system that Trump is terrified about touching yet he promised to remove it lmao another failed trump promise. That's another thing kiddo Obama kept all his promises! Trump can't keep a single one lmaooo. Thanks for reminding me just how superior Obama is than Trump! 

You can thank trump for China stealing from us and Russia raping our democracy!  You can thank Obama for healthcare for the rise of out economy and for caring about our veterans!

Also just to rub it in your face Obama is even better at Twitter! He's got 20 of the most popular tweets! Trump has none ;);)

Well I was wrong about 100 mil
It's actually 60 something million for his first few months but don't worry! As the months go by that number will just get bigger! ( It's already far to big since he ragged on Obama for golfing like three times in his whole presidency)

dzhavc7,"Sure, as long as we can be civil which I think we can be very easily. I am also happy to hear your point of view about why you supported your candidate if it wasn't Trump (which is cool with me either way). This post is going to be long, but it's an honest recollection of what pulled me to Trump.

**Let me preface things**

Yes, I'm white. I can understand that there's probably a data driven point you would like to make. I do live in CA, and have considered myself left leaning up until this election. I also don't consider myself to be a Republican; this election pulled me to the center.  

I was all about Hillary in 2012 for the primary, and even though she lost that bid I looked forward to her potentially gunning for 2016. When she announced her bid for 2016, I was happy. Bernie himself was ok - my younger sister talked him up, and I listened as she was wholly invested. When I heard Trump was running in 2015, and read the bizarre headlines coming out like, ""Trump wants to shutdown the internet,"" I firmly believed he was running as a Republican to simply help Hillary win. I sincerely thought, ""Who could vote for this guy?"" And that was it. I just ignored / dismissed the 'opposition' until February 2016.


**So why did I support Trump? (Primaries to presidency)**  


My support started growing during the DNC/RNC primary debates. DNC debates seemed like the typical stuff I was used to (bettering the country, why X is the better candidate, what candidate Y would do over candidate Z etc.) - mixed in with controversy about the Clinton email server fiasco, and the stuff coming out of the RNC candidates' mouths. I ignored the RNC primaries altogether until I saw the /r/bestof post about Marco Rubio repeating himself 4 times during a debate with his canned response about 'Obama knowing exactly what he is doing' and how laughable it was. 

And in that video, I noticed Trump standing there among the sheer amount of RNC candidates running at the time, and just decided to just listen to him to see what crazy stupid thing he would say for the next media talking point. (Feb 2016). And his responses to the questions seemed reasonable. 

So March 2016 rolls around - EU is having problems with terrorist attacks, the RNC primaries began, and Trump is out in the lead. I'm listening more and more to both sides. Trump is plowing through the RNC contests like no tomorrow, and I observed how the RNC was simply abandoning Trump. But his message still resonated - wanted to bring back jobs and cut down on illegal immigration (I grew tired of the headlines regarding the U.S/EU terrorist attacks which happened from late 2015 through mid 2016, and found myself thinking, ""Well, another one happened...when will this stop?""). I took note of how the RNC candidates were progressively trying to mimic Trump's message. I was still rooting for a democratic president at this time. 


When Trump took the biggest primary lead of any RNC candidate ever, and the RNC sat on their hands not wanting to fund Trump or work with him until they ultimately had to, I found the situation rather odd. Trump wasn't fitting the mold of a typical Republican I had known to that point, and Republicans resented him. ""The enemy (Trump) of my enemy (RNC) was is my friend"", right? 


Moving forward, July 4th happened -- Hillary's health is called into question. And I'll be honest - it cast a lot of doubt. I asked myself if I could see Kaine as president if Hillary ever had to back out due to health issues... and I really couldn't. The VP candidate debate just didn't instill confidence in me that Kaine could step up to the plate if need be. 


One other thing that pulled me more towards Trump was that Hillary seemed to be taking a back seat in her campaign efforts (I rationalize this as health issues instead of confidence), while Trump was looking like he was working overtime. I know people mocked Trump for his early morning tweets, but to me I saw someone who would be ready at the drop of a hat. This factored into my decision - it seemed like he wanted the presidency. And when he met with Mexico's president in August (Hillary unfortunately couldn't attend), he conducted himself actually very well throughout that meeting. To me, he was presidential.


And I will not forget the bad aspects -- Trump had his more major controversies (pussy tape), and his college scandal to name a couple. Hillary had her more major controversies as well -- re-opening Investigation before election and the DNC wikileaks drama. I saw the spin on both sides. And to be honest, up to that point it came down to the following:

If I had to vote for someone, I'd rather vote for the businessman who was a political outsider who demonstrated the energy and didn't have the health problems. 


**So why do I continue supporting Trump**

I personally believe he is acting upon his promises to better the United States. Whether we can agree if the methods or results are appropriate or not is one thing, and hey, I get it. I'm actually going to keep this part short because the message is: I feel he hasn't done anything flagrant/egregious based on what he was campaigning for, and I do believe the country is in a better spot since he started. 

But I will say, if he does do anything flagrant/egregious, then I will be right there protesting alongside you or anyone else who feels the same way.

I mean there are so many show stoppers with Trump that to me your wording greatly downplays, while your primary gripe with Hillary sounds like it's based on the possibility that she may have health concerns and her VP.

Some specifics off the top of my head, how do you feel about:

Trump supporting anti vaxxers

Trump denying global warming

Trump rallyiny US citizens with the birther movement

Trump picking pence

Trump scamming Americans with his University

Trump refusing to be transparent with his finances and not divesting himself of his companies

Trump calling other countries shitholes

Trump casually suggesting ignoring constitutional due process

Huh???

>I grew tired of the headlines regarding the U.S/EU terrorist attacks which happened from late 2015 through mid 2016, and found myself thinking, ""Well, another one happened...when will this stop?""

How do you feel about the school shooting headlines?

>If I had to vote for someone, I'd rather vote for the businessman who was a political outsider who demonstrated the energy and didn't have the health problems.

I think you’ve provided the single most legitimate sounding reasoning that I’ve ever heard to support trump —- I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to write this up.

dzjxpnv,"Thank you so much for being honest and sharing your story.

But I must say, it looks like a lot of the media scare tactics worked on you. What effect does Hilary's email server, terrorism, the contents of the wiki leaks dump or anything else Fox News drummed up have on American life currently? \` What change has there been in illegal immigration other than to get more strict since the Bush era? \(The email server should have been a slap on the wrist for being stupid. The CIA, FBI, NSA etc. have done a great job of keeping terrorism out of the US \(apart from domestic gunmen\). What from the WikiLeaks dump affects current American life? Bush was focused on border security and Obama only ramped that up in response to national concern.

The notion that the US was failing so we had to elect Trump was a suicidal notion for the US. And from what I can see the people that supported it  fell into three camps

1\) they were greedy and saw profit in having another Republican president, no matter who that person was. 

2\) they decidedly wanted the downfall of the US.

3\) they were scared into it by the greedy people and the people who wanted the downfall of the US.",thedonald,2,1527249362.0,comment

> BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Doug Jones, a Democratic former prosecutor who mounted a seemingly quixotic Senate campaign in the face of Republican dominance here, defeated his scandal-scarred opponent, Roy S. Moore, after a brutal campaign marked by accusations of sexual abuse and child molestation against the Republican, according to The Associated Press.

> Mr. Moore&#039;s success in the Republican primary here, and the subsequent general-election fiasco, may deter mainstream Republicans from seeking office in 2018 and could prompt entrenched incumbents to consider retirement.

> National Republican officials abandoned Mr. Moore&#039;s campaign as his defense proved wanting - he initially said he had never pursued a girl without receiving her mother&#039;s permission before subsequently denying he knew any of the women.

dr6kbdr,"Not quite cowardly, kinda an asshole thing to say really. 


You can fully oppose a candidate yet also chose to not vote for the one of the party you support as they do not represent you, whilst supporting the main parties position. 


Voting is a choice, the impact is that you can't really complain about the outcome if you chose not to vote and your candidate lost. 


Had he won: People would of likely been uncomfortable with the person, but been in a degree of hope that their shittiness would not get in the way of the partys goal for their country. 

Had he lost: That is fine, the other people chose to vote and they will then hope the other candidate  at least represents some of the same positions. 


In so few words: Just because one candidate is a piece of shit, it doesn't make somebody have to vote for the other guy, that is choice. 

Different take: Let's say I'm a tory(I'm not, i dislike those twats to no end), and theresa may is being theresa may. That won't instantly make me go out to vote for Pat Mcdonald (the labour opposing candidate for Maidenhead MP - Mays home constituency). I'd rather just not vote for either. 


Or like in your election where people hated Trump, but also thought Clinton was a piece of shit. They would rather not participate for what they viewed as a dumpster fire on either side. It's not cowardly, it's simply that if your choices are shit | shit | neither, many would prefer to not contribute to the next shit. 


TL:DR: Saying it's cowardly is childish and being blinded by your own bias. Simply put: It is okay to think Moore is a sack of shit, and that Jones does not represent your position in politics. In such a case, people would rather not contribute to either side, so they don't vote for an alleged pedophile who's party views are more inline with their own views and they also don't vote for somebody who will push policy that they oppose. 


TL:DR:TL:DR To flip your point: Is it cowardly in the last election if people who disliked Clinton just chose not to vote for her or Trump, whilst in your view they should vote for Trump if they refuse to vote for Clinton?",thedonald,12,1513159980.0,comment

dr6lvb9,">No... The majority of republicans aren't ignorant racist rednecks. 

While you're absolutely right, there are those on that side who unfortunately cement that belief in others' minds, while having the means and the platform to be heard well outside their area. 

Roy Moore is a perfect example, as was displayed today when a campaign spokesman said, on live TV, that Muslims shouldn't be able hold office, because to be sworn in, you **have** to swear on the Bible, and apparently their skin sizzles if they come into contact with a Bible. This requirement, that you must swear on the Bible is of course not true, yet his reaction to that news (stunned silence) made it clear that no one once questioned these policies at a high enough level in Moore's camp. And this can easily be considered the least troubling of Moore's policies and stances. 

So while it's not right to label all Republicans as uneducated rednecks, Republicans should really reconsider who they decide to back and align themselves with, because Roy Moore is the epitome of the ignorant, racist redneck stereotype, who said and did awful things while a majority on the right either didn't care,  stayed silent, or abandoned their party's stated principles by doubling down on their support of Moore. 

I've never believed that the entire Republican party, from the leadership down to individual voters, was anything close to fitting that stereotype. That said, there are enough Republicans in prominent positions whose actions only harm both the party and its perception of where its true values lie.

And I can already hear the whataboutisms being desperately typed out, so let me save you the trouble. This is hardly a Republican problem only, but the reason I am specifically bringing it up now is because a) it's the topic at hand, and b) the very embodiment of that stereotype came close to actually winning in Alabama today, so it's relevant to the discussion. ",thedonald,16,1513164060.0,comment
dr6pt66,"They are ignorant, and it's because they demonize college and hate intellectualism. And its what Trump appeals to - emotion instead of intelligence.

They are typically bigots, they absolutely have negative obsessions with racial stereotypes. And again, it's what Trump appeals to - us whites vs them immigrants.

They are rednecks, and sometimes they'll even proudly admit to it. Again, Trump knows his base, that's why he made trucker hats.

The problem is (and I know this because of where I've lived) when you insult someone with the truth about them, they tend to get very, very, very fucking upset.

If you ask these people if they're better off without college, most will say yes, because colleges exist only to convert children into liberals. But dont you dare suggest that this attitude is associated in any way with ignorance. Ignorance is the most accurate word to use in this context, but it cuts them to the core. Not least of all because they don't know what it means and they assume its the same as when they call a liberal ""retarded"" on reddit.

They are ignorant, and racist, and redneck, but calling them such will only trigger them so hard their unborn children will be inbred. If you want to have a dialogue with them (not on Reddit obviously) try to avoid the painful truths.",thedonald,4,1513171635.0,comment
dr6l7c3,"Here's the thing, though. There's a gap in the republican base. It consists of business owners/rich people and poor ""rednecks"". 

 The rednecks want their guns and think everyone should have to earn their living, because they themselves earn their living and struggle to get by. They think we need a smaller government because taxes are what is keeping them in poverty, and not the fact that unregulated capitalism leads to inefficient means of income for the labor force. 

Then we have the rich telling them that Democrats want to grow government and restrict people's freedom. When in reality, Democrats are more concerned with regulating businesses, and not individuals in the labor force. 

And Republicans propagate the conflation of regulating business with restricting individuals freedoms. On the topic of the latter, if you're a business owner, then yeah, you don't want your business regulated and in a way that restricts your freedoms. But it makes absolutely no sense for these poverty stricken, entry level ""rednecks"" to vote republican.

dr6k173,"That's more for revolutions. 


To have a revolution and be successful, you only need around 1/3rd of the country in support, whilst it is likely only 1/3rd would side in favor of the current system and the rest would be in the came of wanting to live and didn't wish to choose a side as they didn't speak to either.


You could argue that the American civil war was in a way like this, whilst foreign backing may influence things, the 1 3rd system does still appear, such as in the American revolution where there existed massive french backing. 


Cases that somewhat demonstrate how you do need 1/3rd  of support can be seen in the Syrian Civil war, where the opposition struggled to get more than 1/10th of the nation supporting them, although foreign backing allowed that one to last as long as it did.

Libya could be said to follow an exception of sorts, as a stronger foreign military destroyed the side with more support, yet there was also a larger neutral ground in that case. 


Yemen potentially follows the same rule but with hard limits, where the old government does have large foreign backing, but holds little internal support, whilst the foreign support seems to hold minimal effect.


The Rise of ISIS is something of an inverse effect, where the weaker opposing forces would switch sides instead of die fighting, as noted by how several of the SDF Deirz ezzor military council members (some who have since been removed) were noted as ex FSA who became ex ISIS before joining the SDF. Abu Khawla being one case. In many situations, we saw a few small holdouts from groups who may be persecuted or just killed, such as kobaine, deirz ezzor city , etc, yet in ISIS areas the 1/3rd rule didn't really apply.


But anyway, in short: The rule is more for revolutions or internal conflict.  it is not really about outright killing, although some would say that is what conflict is. ",thedonald,15,1513159223.0,comment

dr6r6az,"I get that point, but meanings quickly change depending on the context, and at least here on Reddit, it's now pretty much synonymous with a comment that doesn't actually have any other argument except the initial ""But what about X"" question, sometimes not even following up with anything. Just asking that question with no added information. Hell, I've seen comments where they're clearly asking that question as a weak attempt to undermine everything the previous poster had written by calling into question their biases, only to then sincerely end their comment asking if someone else can either fill them in or ""prove"" why the other person was wrong, because calling into question someones biases on a subject they can't even be bothered to at least skim Wikipedia on is really all it takes to get the ball rolling. It's never about an argument with the kind of people who do this. They just want to sling shit and stop the conversation all together.

>Throwing out the term whataboutism just to discredit a valid argument is a bit ironic. 

That's just it, though: in the context of these kind of comments, I'm not discrediting anything as the they're not making any kind of argument one can discredit; there is nothing but a literal appeal to authority who shares their biases to make their argument for them. And if they do go further than asking the ""But what about X"" question, they're likely intentionally throwing out other questions about the ""other side"" that aren't even tangentially related to the topic at hand, but are specifically asked/worked to rile everyone up enough to overwhelm the mods' abilities to actually moderate effectively. If it becomes too difficult for the mods to manage, they lock the thread at the very least. They may also start deleting comments where any divergence began, but some times, even that's not clear enough as by the time the mods step in, anyone still making comments are doing it solely to hurl insults, so they'll just nuke the entire chain of comments instead. 

So if they play their cards right they can at least get the thread locked by riling enough people up (which is pretty common as is without any added help) effectively killing all the discussion for everyone, and potentially, get the entire comment chain/section nuked out completely because it was too time consuming to sift through the waste to find the few decent comments, effectively ensuring most people will never come come across the offending arguments that caused this in the first place.

Also thanks for the response. Another question if that's alright: 

How can you comfortably vote for the republicans despite their clear support for far-right anti humanist ideology? We can all agree in our dislike for Trump, but it's the Republican party that gives him his platform and defends him in his actions, whilst acting on his sensationalism to strip people of their rights and bolster the power of the few.

Don't get me wrong, I hate that America is stuck with Neo-Liberals as it's only real choice, but surely that is much much better than anything the republicans have to offer?

dr7cccu,"- 1) Ah, I think you misread my first question.

- 2) I would care were there any real evidence supporting the idea that it's actually some sort of epidemic. However, all of this can easily be explained when you consider how the front page has always worked, and how common circle jerks have always been. This sort of thing is not new to reddit in the slightest.

- 3) & 4) I'm aware that T_D bot; I wasn't insinuating that you thought they didn't. My point is reading the idea that these left wing bots are so efficient that they can increase a karma score into the tens of thousands on multiple subreddits, on levels that T_D could only dream of, despite the fact that T_D pioneered that shit and Russia is actively involved in those sorts of tactics. Why is it that these left wing bots are so much better, is my question? And who's creating them? It can't just be ShareBlue surely? Because if they can do it so efficiently, then anyone can.

Cognitive dissonance is real, so getting someone to make a change requires finesse.  I see the way Reddit approaches ""the other side"" of politics (or anything that you can be opinionated about) and is just condescending as fuck - even if they're objectively wrong (e.g. I am a medical professional and commented one time about the manner in which an intramuscular shot was given in a picture was wrong, because they *felt* I was wrong I was berated with downvotes and unkind comments).  It's not our job to lord over the other side and wag our dick in their face: It's our job, as a human, to show some goddamn human decency and ask them questions about why they believe the way they do, root out a causation, and attempt a change there not by *attacking their character* - which will immediately result in resistance and diminish any chance you had of changing their mind - but by meeting them eye to eye and explaining how people can suffer from what they're doing or saying.

dr7470b,"You’re right. We should start asking republicans the real questions and give them a chance to respond reasonably, because they have such a great history of doing so. Let’s start with these questions:

-Why did you elect a President that openly brags about committing sexual assault?

-Why did you stand behind and promote a serial pedophile to be elected over a prosecutor that prosecuted the KKK? And why did 49.4% of your voters actually vote for him?

-Why do the women in your party promote the good ole boys that don’t care for a second about a woman’s body? Is a tax break for your rich friend really more important than you making decision about what you can and cannot do to your own body? Are you ok with white, chauvinist males making all decisions for you?

-What are you going to do about the wage gap and impending class warfare that your party is so fucking dead set on creating?

-How do you feel about the blatantly racist legislation that your party routinely pushes for, and sadly, passes on a regular basis? How do you feel about the fact that these racist policies are solely to attract the poor, southern, white vote even though all southern, white, poor people that vote republican are voting against their own financial interests?

-When is your party going to stop basing their fucking legislation on the fairy tale bearded dude in the sky and actually separate church from state as our founding fathers intended?

-When are you going to stop illegally gerrymandering to win elections?

-When will your party start listening to EVERY GODAMN SCIENTIST IN THE WORLD and start doing something about global warming?

Now that I’ve typed it out, I see your point. Civil discourse is obviously what we need with republicans.

dzbqzvo,"First: Some left wing people own guns too, for protection from both internal and external threats.

Second: The mental health/state of an individual and the actions they may take fueled by their ideological bias do not account for any single ideology as each extreme from the political spectrum is an undesirable manifestation and we can all agree that school shooters, mass shooters etc. are all mentally unhealthy people regardless of their political orientation. Not to mention the fact that most of these shootings aren't driven by politics but the desire to show a hatred for being itself.

Third: The counter protestors at Charlottesville were not peaceful. They surrounded a man in his car as he tried to pass peacefully and slowly while armed guys dressed in black surrounded the car and started acting like drunk football hooligans who just watched their team lose. I would have done the exact same thing and the women who was ""killed"" actually died from a heart attack, please do not be so willingly ignorant. Left or right, we can agree that what happened in Charlottesville was not an acceptable form of counter protest. 

Fourth: The violent and fascist agenda to shut down speeches with whom certain groups disagree with is too much on the left at the moment. Please point out to me the re-occuring instances of violent right wing protestors hitting people over the head with bike locks, or breaking church windows as a peaceful renowned clinical psychologist, Jordan B. Peterson, tries to speak on the issue of free speech. Openly calling to violence those demented enough to believe you can and should punch people for their differing yet peacefully argued albeit hateful opinions. Violence is bad on either side of the aisle but just because it happens more in your aisle doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist and pretending so just to reassure yourself of your ideological bias will only turn you into an ideologue. It's a measurable fact that the left has a violence issue that needs to be sorted so the rest of us can have a civil conversation, disagree and still break bread at the end of the day.

OK, but you're being dishonest here- the thing that Jordan B. Peterson is popularly known for is expressing far-right views, not his clinical psychology work. Regardless of whether the behavior of protesters was appropriate, you can't not mention that when you're talking about him. 

You're deliberately phrasing your statements in a way that makes the people you dislike look worse by leaving out important information- I believe the phrase I've seen right-wing people often use is ""pushing a narrative.""

The only person who has even tried to argue that it was a left leaning movement that wasn’t full of shit  was Mises and he was really only making that argument based purely on their economic views and not the social or political ones.

Also, the ""enforced monogamy"" thing which, you know, I try not to base too much of my view of a person on one comment (it can always be out of context or a poor phrasing) but like that's just creepy incel apologism.

In any case, my original point still stands: *you are being dishonest by trying to make it seem like Jordan Peterson is some innocuous clinical psychologist that leftists inexplicably decided to violently protest against*.

dzbo5sm,">Hurt obtained a copy of her sworn divorce deposition, from 1990, in which she stated that, the previous year, her husband had raped her in a fit of rage. In Hurt’s account, Trump was furious that a “scalp reduction” operation he’d undergone to eliminate a bald spot had been unexpectedly painful. Ivana had recommended the plastic surgeon. In retaliation, Hurt wrote, Trump yanked out a handful of his wife’s hair, and then forced himself on her sexually. Afterward, according to the book, she spent the night locked in a bedroom, crying; in the morning, Trump asked her, “with menacing casualness, ‘Does it hurt?’ ” Trump has denied both the rape allegation and the suggestion that he had a scalp-reduction procedure. Hurt said that the incident, which is detailed in Ivana’s deposition, was confirmed by two of her friends.

I'm not getting into a long, pointless debate, but nothing listed in the title has any merit grounded in reality. Even MSNBC proved he pays millions in taxes, for example.  He's said and done nothing racist. Securing a border from *illegal* immigration does not mean racism or dislike of mexicans. That's all I care to put in because it'll fall on deaf ears anyway.

At the very lest you should at least reflect yourself and as cliche it nowadays is ""check your priviledge"" ( I rarely use that term because it's poisoned by nazis but it actually works in this case). You are obviously owning some racist ideals (maybe unknowingly, but that doesn't excuse it) and you might become target to nazi recruiment. 

Just don't post shit like this again and maybe you'll turn out okay. I also suggest you should take a race relations 101 course (if you're in uni that has one) or at least read some books on that subject.

Oh I believe it.   Not just racism. Look at how those who hold cultural power divide everyone.  The entire population is being played like a fiddle.  Those who control the culture shaping tools know exactly what they're doing.  Take a look at ""trending"" in YouTube. Any given day, you'll find: something makeup related from some no-name nobody, something hip hop related with sexually suggestive material, lowest common denominator targeted drama, clips from the left biased late night shows, something LGBT related, something that targets broke millennials but has to do with wealthy people buying, trying, or playing with expensive items or foods, and typically something from buzzfeed or vox that causes endless arguments between the pc and anti pc crowd.

Every day you can find 90% of the above on trending. You'll never see anything that leans right of center. You'll never see music featured that's not hip-hop, rap, or pop.  That's just youtube.  Curated, agenda driven content is produced for the purpose of causing conflict, not understanding and conversation. 

Every media platform is working to keep everyone fighting and it's working.  It's caused Trump to be elected president.  It's caused people to become dumber and blindly believe so much garbage all along the political spectrum.  When we're being bombarded by such material constantly, it's no surprise that people are spreading farther apart politically. It's divide and conquer.  

CNN and MSNBC feed you leftist propaganda. Fox feeds you far right propaganda. Discussions can't happen because both sides hate each other so the end result is ""libtard, communist scum snowflakes"" clashing with ""racist, bigoted, capitalist scum white people."" Media and content masters would have us believe it's all black and white and it's nowhere near that simple.  If everyone in America turned off their televisions and smartphones for a week and talked to each other, we'd live in a completely different environment.

Fuck. Sorry for the rant.  I'm just sick of people fighting the left vs right fight when it's actually you and me vs the powerful and influential and nobody seems to see it.

You're wasting your time. Fascist projection is rampant here. Either go with the leftist narrative or perish.

Well good for you. But the phrase, ""putting words in my mouth"" is to say that someone means something other than what they actually mean.

For me to have ""put words in your mouth"" in that instance, I'd have had to say something like:

""You said/think that if a woman lets you have sex with her, it’s rape, but only if you’re a Republican.""

I wasn't implying or explicitly saying you meant something by my statement. It was an analogy to highlight the absurdity of your rationalization by applying it to a more extreme scenario.",thedonald,0,1527717391.0,comment

dzmtcdh,"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority comes from the metacognitive inability of low-ability people to recognize their lack of ability; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

On the other hand, people of high ability may incorrectly assume that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for other people, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are experienced in.

Illegal immigrants immigrated illegally, but may actually be present and documented in the country legally (for instance, if they are asylum seekers).

Undocumented immigrants are present and undocumented in the country illegally, but generally immigrated completely legally. Their presence only became illegal after the fact, usually due to a work visa expiring (often due to not understanding how to get it renewed) or general clerical errors.

Immigrants who both immigrated illegally and remained undocumented are actually relatively uncommon.

Ironically, this is how a child thinks. ""I don't like math, it's stupid."" Now of course math can't be stupid, but a child automatically calls anything it doesn't like ""stupid.""

dzr3j0r,"All good. Although this sub has turned into an anti-trump sub now it appears so be prepared. 

Basically I don't think Trump consciously thinks of himself as a fascist but there are many things he does in the fascist tradition. 

- constantly denouncing any press that is negative to him as ""fake"". It's a barely veiled version of ""lugenpresse"" that Nazis were using at his early rallies.

- setting himself up as the one and only saviour ""I alone can fix it""

- intense counter productive nationalism

- whipping people into scary chants to lock up his political opponents ""lock her up""

- has nothing but criticism for traditional allies, but expresses admiration for anti democratic vipers like Duterte and Putin. 

- constant, bold faced lies. It creates an atmosphere of ""what actually is real and what is truth"". Old Russian technique to disrupt democracies. 

- has zero interest in reaching out to his opponents, taunts and insults those on the other side. Governs only in the interests of his supporters and fuck everyone else. 

- tacit approval of fascists and white supremacists. See Charlottesville. Disgusting. 

I mean, I could go on and on but I have to get back to work.

They swear that there's some kind of child concentration camp in Antarctica, a rape 'island' that rich people pay to go have sex with kids, some kind of secret plane they use to traffic adults and children...
They're waiting for a huge information bomb to come out that will bring all of 'this' to light and Q-anon posts cryptic messages about it.

Here’s the more complex one: nazis were/are extreme nationalist(sound familiar?) who were also xenophobic(again)they vilified ethnic minorities(very familiar) which eventually led to NATIONALLY socializing their industry(read: stealing the corporations for national priorities). Then the started committing ethnic, genetic cleansing(basically killing, imprisoning, raping, anyone whom they thought was scary; IE Jews,gays,gypsies,mentally retarded, handicapped or otherwise undesirable)

dzf7u6m,"**Nazism**

National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus), more commonly known as Nazism (), is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party – officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP) – in Nazi Germany, and of other far-right groups with similar aims.

Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system, but also incorporated fervent antisemitism, scientific racism and eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the Völkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time, and it was strongly influenced by the anti-Communist Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's ""cult of violence"" which was ""at the heart of the movement.""

Nazism subscribed to theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race. It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft).

dzfanwn,"The communists and socialists were two sides of the same coin. They used to fight against each other but they had more in common than they disagreed. The biggest difference was the Nazis hated Jews, while the communists were tolerant of Jews, as long as they didn’t practice their religion publicly. 

Both of them have both a personal component and an industrial/economic component to try to establish a perfect society. Nazis stress transformation of the person whereas communists stress the transformation of production and the economy. But neither neglects the other component.

Marxist philosophy actually refers to socialism as a middle stage between the workers’ revolution and the communist utopia. Such a philosophy calls for industrialization and production to be controlled by the government.
But the government would also be responsible for re-education of individuals until they embrace the communist ideal.

Such a philosophy calls for the elimination of persons and races that cannot or will not embrace the way of life in the utopia.",thedonald,0,1527044668.0,comment

Oh yes. /u/JurgenWindcaller, since you probably didnt look it up, I did it for you. See if any of this sounds familiar:

>Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.

I have said it before but your comment is filled with micro-aggravations, so I will not.

Why would I want to deny his prestige in a glorified poetry genre. 

>in addition he is also a comedian and an actor and anyone who can do all of these things successfully deserves praise.

I have already said he is charming, which is how he does it. Are you illiterate? 

>living a long life doesn't mean shit all it means is that you didn't die and if you live in a first world country that's pretty easy so stop acting all high and mighty just because you were born before me.

Perhaps not, but living a long life is one of the largest disappointments of my life, I always hoped I would die of a heart attack in my sixties or something, oh yes. 

>the sentient tangerine named Donald has also lived a long life, would you consider him wise and knowledgeable?

I do not like Trump or his views as I believe he is wrong for the United States, a country I used to live in, but if you are criticising me for the things I am saying about Glover but not considering the man who made it to be president at 70 to be wise and knowledgeable, I seriously think you're just trying to attack me. Most of us hate Trump, but to say he's not wise or knowledgeable would be wrong.

dzzbguu,"my comments are filled with micro aggressions because you make these claims without a but of proof or even supporting anecdote, I am sorry if that has turned you away from discussion but it bothers me when people say something then dodge me when I ask for supporting proof. calling rap glorified poetry doesn't really work in my opinion because you also have to incorporate music which I think takes a lot of effort. you keep saying he should not be getting all the praise he is getting but you refuse to explain why or how you have the authority to make this claim. and once again, just because you have lived a long time does not mean anything in and of itself. if you have lived in a first world country your entire life then it especially doesn't mean anything, and making it above the average age doesn't suddenly grant you wisdom. once again, I would like to have a friendly conversation with you and I apologize for any aggression that may come off but presenting your birth certificate gives you no credibility whatsoever, I need you to understand this and give some examples of what you have accomplished or some life experience that shows your criticisms should have some weight. not trying to be rude, but how do I know you're not an angry old man who doesn't like black people and their new fangled rap music? alternatively how do you know I'm not a 10 year old who loves Glover and will defend him tooth and claw?

If being in a diverse city shackles you to a diverse mindset of people that don’t agree with your conservative mindset, and your answer is to move to a city that is far less diverse, and unsurprisingly has a larger base of “Trump” fans, then perhaps the problem isn’t diversity at all, but rather you want to be around more like-minded people that recall a very different recent past than those that come up from a history of persecution. Also, Dallas is as purple as Mars. 

You keep bringing up your (probably fictional) gay republican friends, like your outlier anecdotal experience is somehow representative of a silent majority, when I can just as anecdotally point out large swaths of gay and minority culture, many of whom are family and friends, would mention that you are full of shit.  You can totally be gay and republican, we even see it all the time in politicians that strike out at gay culture only to be found at a bathroom glory hole or abusing little boys.  There are outliers in every culture, but Trump culture is about “fuck your feelings, fuck your facts, Trump can’t do wrong, he said so”, and the majority of the country can’t wait for this era to be over.

dzg4zfk,"I’m not judging a book, I’m judging The_Donald, which is a vile cesspool of Internet humanity that makes the average viewing audience of Fox and Friends look like levelheaded straight shooters.

You don’t have to lecture me on diversity of thought. I’m an independent that only leans left based on my own research and experience. My first vote was for GWBush, and over time I realized what an awful choice that was based on the culture of a military family having grown up around Reagan, whom wasn’t exposed to be a fraud as of yet, and I grew to hate our binary political system that offers a bad choice and a worse choice as our main options most years. I don’t dislike something political because of groupthink, I make up my own mind, which is why I don’t follow any particular news source expressly or join anything like The_Donald.

The_Donald is not where I’d go for free thought and constructive conversation. I have all sorts of friends, and many of whom I don’t agree with, but they are friends because we can all discuss and have legit opportunity to see their state of mind and adjust. There is no such thing as left media bias when 6 corporations own all the news and pit profitable factions against each other. Trump voters are by and large the most massive group of brainwashed citizens that I have ever come across politically, by a country mile. 

I’ll admit when there is something I agree with from someone I don’t like, (H1b1 visa banning is actually the lone high point of Trump for me), and I’m not opposed to pointing out things I don’t like about people I do respect (Obama was a good president and a better man, but I didn’t agree with all his positions and actions).

He’s racist, nothing will ever change what he did to Obama with that ugly campaign he spearheaded. He’s not really all that intelligent. He got far in life based on luck (inheritance) and conning people. China is kicking his ass in negotiations. His tax policy is growing more unpopular daily (Harley is making him look like a fool in both tax and trade). Every feather in his cap economically is based on riding the machine Obama built and calling it his own, and every change he’s attempting to make is making a downturn to the economy inevitable. 

He’s already losing in Korea, who clearly have played and will continue to play him. He’s losing in China, and supports the endless war in the Middle East, like every bad decision every other president before him has made. 

The only verifiable changes he has made is show how easy it is to con the public into voting against their own interests and calling it patriotism, and making it ok to be an absolute dick to your fellow man out in the open, all while eroding relationships with just about every ally we have by talking straight from his asshole.
