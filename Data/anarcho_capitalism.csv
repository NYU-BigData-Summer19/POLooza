dmw1equ,"The fact that TSA hasn't ""caught"" any terrorists since 2003 would only be a criticism if there was actually a successful terrorist attack on a commercial airliner flying within, or from the United States since that time. There has not been such an event since 9/11 nor has there been an attempt. I am not saying that the TSA is a perfect agency that employs perfect people but they do a very difficult job that is extraordinarily necessary for national security. The fact that NO terrorists have been caught and NO terrorist attacks have involved airliners within the US since 2001 is actually a testament to post-9/11 security measures enforced by the TSA. Deterring terrorists from a attempting a terrorist attack is more of an accomplishment than catching one in an attempt. So until terrorists effectively breach TSA security and carry out a successful attack, shut the fuck up and put your shoes in the bin, you whiney sack of shit.

dmvo54x,The fact that they have arrested zero terrorists can mean two things. One is that they have failed at catching terrorists and the other one is that terrorists don't make it to the airport. It is the second option that is the fact. Terrorists don't make it to the airport because the intelligence community diverts their plans and because terrorists know they aren't going to be able to fool the TSA. It's an effective measure. What if there was no TSA? Then it would be incredibly easy to highjack planes.,Anarcho_Capitalism,-1,1505174328.0,comment

dmwalpo,"No - because 9/11 broke the model.

In the past, when a plane was hijacked it was for ransom - so the prevailing wisdom for the passengers was to ""sit down, shut up and pray"" because if no one resisted, then most of the passengers would survive the incident.

9/11 changed that math because they used the plane as a missile which had 100% kill rate of the passengers. Not to mention that governments will shoot down a hijacked plane rather than risk it being used as a weapon.

At that point, instead of the passengers sitting down and shutting up and having a relatively high chance of survival, they now have a high likelihood of 0% chance of survival so resistance becomes a no-brainer.

What happens the day you cancel the TSA? No more terrorist attacks? Don't you see how easy it would become to hijack an airplane?

>We don't need the TSA to protect us because hijacking a plane has zero benefit to a terrorist.

As all suicide bombings have shown us, terrorists are ready to lose their own life to kill others regardless of the means. It can be on a train, on an airplane, at the market...

> Either they want to ransom it or they want to use it in a 9/11 style attack - neither of which can happen because of what I explained above.

Neither of which can happen because the TSA prevents them. If a terrorist organization know they can't achieve an attack, they will try something else. If they know they will get caught 100% of the time, they won't try it.

>So essentially the only objective of attacking a plane that is left is to kill people - and there are a lot of easier targets to kill more people - hell attacking the airports themselves are a better target than an airplane.

Do you realize that 9/11 killed nearly 3,000 people. Sure we have seen a terrorist kill 100 people in France, but if you took control of a 747, you could kill 500 people. There is a good reason we have security at airports.

>Not to mention, you do realize that we had airport security, metal detectors and luggage xrays before the TSA existed right?

Yes, because terrorism was already a threat well before 9/11. Just look at this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_airliner_bombing_attacks)

Also, don't you remember just a few months ago when they started banning laptops on airplanes going to the US from certain countries because these airports weren't equipped to detect new threats? Even though the terrorists know they can't win now, they are always trying to find a way to trick the TSA. If the TSA isn't up to date, then the terrorists win.

Getting rid of the TSA doesn't mean we wouldn't have any airport security.

We had airport security before the TSA and we can still have it after. The TSA is a massive and bloated bureaucracy which has to manufacture a sense that is taking actions to remain relevant and protect its obscene funding. The TSA is also inept and incompetent.

Do you realize you are more likely to be killed by a police officer in the US than a terrorist? Not to mention, you are 8 times more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by a terrorist.

If you want to see what real security looks like and how to deal with real and persistent terrorist threats - look at countries like Israel which have survived being on the front lines of terrorism for 60 years.

Quite frankly, we have to take an acceptable losses approach - it is impossible to prevent every attack - so we need to figure out what an appropriate cost is for the risk - handle it like any other risk assessment - not this bullshit panicky *OMHGerd DATerrorist*

BTW: The ultimate goal of terrorist, isn't to kill people, it is to create political change through terrorizing and terrifying people.

They want us to act differently because we are afraid.

What you don't realize is that I have been targeted by terrorists during the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. I flew on one of the flights they wanted to blow up. And why am I alive today? It is because of good intelligence. I am alive because the British police cared more for the right to live of a Canadian ten year old than the privacy of a Pakistani terrorist. They spied on these guys 24/7 so they could find every single odd detail about them to prevent this attack. And they did just that. They saved hundreds of lives including my own. I care to defeat terrorists and your philosophy on this seems really immoral. You suggest that we let terrorist attacks happen just so terrorists don't get the political gain they are after. This is crazy. I don't want anyone to die because of terrorists and I am ready to sacrifice twenty minutes of everybody's time when they go through security for no one to die in hijackings and bombings. I am willing to have every luggage examined so we do find these improvised detonators that 2006 terrorist was bringing back from Pakistan when he was trained there. In that case, it was the British that did the job, but next time, it'll be the USA. If you think we have to let people die because we lose some and win some, then you are a disgusting individual.

1) I didn't suggest or say anything of the sort. 

2) What the other guy said.

3) I really don't care if you were targeted or not - it doesn't change the actual math - nor does some unverifiable claim create a good argument. 

The simple fact is that the actual risk of being a victim of terrorism is very low compared to the obscene amount of money we spend supposedly to prevent it. 

A death is a death - whether that person is killed in a car accident or by a terrorist - it doesn't make a difference. Why are we spending billions to prevent less likely terrorist victims and millions to prevent more likely automobile deaths?

ea51t0j,"Those ""stairs"" he built were a god damn nightmare waiting for a fucking lawsuit. I love how this is never part of the story.

The stringers are 12 inches apart at most, and the stair treads are hanging over by more than a foot.  This means that any load on the right or left ends of the stair treads becomes a torque force on the opposite stringer because it acts like a lever.

Speaking of levers, what is holding the stairs into the stringer? We could only hope that its some screws instead of nails, but judging by the engineering (or lack of) so far that would be a high order of hope.

Next, the railing, which is held onto the previously mentioned stair treads, NOT a structural member or a structural member itself such as being cemented in concrete. And again, how is it held onto the stair tread? A couple screws?


There's a reason building codes exist. So fucking morons who don't know what they're doing can't put innocent people at risk.

These stairs are supposedly for the elderly. People who are by definition, less sure footed, have slower reflexes, and require sturdy structures to support themselves... you know, like fucking railings that won't fail.

Finally: When, not IF, this abortion of a stair case fails in some way and some elderly person falls and breaks their hip...who is liable? Does this internet hero who built the stairs for $550 carry insurance for his public works projects? (protip: no he doesn't) Is he even worth going after for damages? (protip: he probably doesn't even have enough in savings to cover one day of intensive care) So who gets sued? The City. And what does the city carry? Insurance for just this reason. And what is gauranteed to be one of the clauses of maintaining said coverage? That licensed engineers sign off on all public works.

This reminded me of this scenario...

Romania is in the EU, and as such, it has access to funding for (badly needed) infrastructure projects; subject to EU inspections, reporting, paper trials, etc. (a level of accountability)

Thus, being harder to hide their tracks when making shady deals to move funds towards politicians' and their friends' pockets, Gov prefers to use its ""sovereign"" funds instead. Barely any EU funding is used at all. 

As a result, roads get built and then also rebuilt due to purposefully shoddy quality; government facilities remain in ruins; healthcare is severly underfunded and corrupt, and so people die in the hospitals from bacterial infections; and so on.

Not that I'm a fan of the EU, but at least there's some form of accountability (relatively).

It wouldn't surprise me a bit if the spending numbers were inflated as though hospitals were getting paid what they charge (spoiler, they bill insurance higher prices than insurance will ever pay, but the customer doesn't see the discount rates).

For legit high spending, the US throws resources at end-of-life care in a way that no state-run system could ever dream of doing, driving the number even higher.

But you won’t do that though, because a fulfilling life entails risk, or least life would a boring and expensive affair if your entire life was organized  for safety’s sake, especially if some tutting harridan mother forced you to be safe. If people wanted to use those stairs, even if it is risky, they should be able to do so. What isn’t right is to coerce the cost of “decent” risk mitigation out of people’s pockets when most of them will not ever know the stairs exist.",Anarcho_Capitalism,14,1542739350.0,comment

ea5pn0r,"Libertarians are best summarised as rejectors of the state and authority (although not to the extent of anarchists). 
Instead, libertarians believe in something called the no harm principle which essentially boils down to the idea that if there is no harm being done to others then such an action should not be illegal.

Furthermore, Libertarians are big believers in the free market which they believe acts as an ""invisible hand"" and can solve many problems the state fails to solve.

The key differences between conservatism and libertarianism is that the former tends to prefer an authoritive government and to defend tradition whereas the Libertarian approach is angled at the rejection of all unnecessary action which addresses more than just the harm principle and the belief in the rights of the individual. (essentially so the individual can do as they please, so long as they don't violate the harm principle) I.e: Libertarians would have nothing against homosexuality because it doesn't effect others.

Private property is another key factor of Libertarian belief and is formed on the basis that no one, not even the government should be able to interfere with your private property as it is the fruits of you labour.

Is it better to be able to disempower commies without helicopters? Absolutely - it would be nice if they could be reformed. But commies, murderers, burglars, and criminals must be dealt with to protect society; ultimately when sociopaths refuse to repent they must be dealt with. Its a simple matter of self defense.

ed5vwth,">What happens if someone cheats? How do you set up the rules? How do you have a third party verify that both parties consented to the duel and it wasn’t that someone murdered another and then forged some paperwork?

This is just a question of creating a legally sufficient contract.

It could include terms such as:

An agreed on 'cooling off period' during which either party can cancel the duel.

An agreed on set of rules to be enforced by an agreed upon referee.

Multiple witnesses at all times to confirm that each party consented and 
there was no forgery.

Any weapons are to be inspected both before and after the duel to ensure they were not modified.

Each party must have either a large bond in place or an insurance policy that will provide for their dependents if they die.

Drug testing to ensure they're not under the influence of any chemicals.

In reality this is not that far off from how MMA fights work nowadays. The risk of death is clearly present in MMA fights, just as with duels, and so there are a LOT of checks in place to make sure each party understands what they agree to.

I don't see why its unthinkable to allow for dueling when we allow for bloody fistfights on national TV.

>It’s a good idea in theory but there is a reason it’s no longer happening.

Probably because we have a fully developed legal system and a less honor-focused society so most disputes can be resolved without violence or losing face.

Doesn't imply that a duel won't, in SOME situations, be the best method of resolving a particular conflict. Even if it just convinces one or both parties that its not worth their life so they back off.

******

If you're talking about a scenario where one person kills another and then *claims,* with no additional witnesses or evidence, that it was a consensual duel, then it is simply a *factual* investigation.

Lacking proof that a formal duel was agreed upon, there's likely going to be a strong presumption in favor of murder.

And justifiable self-defense would be a MUCH more common justification. Which, again, we have NOW and it entails investigation into the surrounding circumstances to determine the truth as best we can.",Anarcho_Capitalism,67,1546537630.0,comment

Have them go to a therapist and verify they are making the decision in their right mind. Have them put it in their will and have their lawyer confirm it's their wishes or something... I feel like we could figure this one out but I think your points on the dueling are pretty strong since it could be spontaneous, something I don't think would happen with euthanasia.

Not all duels need be fought with firearms. A duel is a contest of wills, sometimes a contest of physical prowess, and rarely a contest of lives. Two guys beating the hell out of each other can be framed as a duel. A knife fight can be a duel. And sometimes, all you need to do is get a couple of good hits in to get your point across.

Not sure where the issue of personal roles in commerce came into play. My original question was posited toward the assertion in the OP, that consenting adults can and do have the legal right to duel without repercussion from the law.

Ping-pong, Starcraft, and Chess are battles of will.

Threatening to beat people up only works when the result of a confrontation is assured.  And there's no inherent incentive for you to go into a duel and get your clock cleaned.

> Not sure where the issue of personal roles in commerce came into play.

>> Perhaps, in order to remove them as a negative factor, you need to incapacitate their ability to continue to operate.

While there's plenty of incentive to physically incapacitate a business rival, there's little reason for a business rival to accept if she believes she's at a disadvantage.

So either you're taking a big risk with a small reward (you're the idiot) or you're banking on your opponent doing the same.  Either way, duels only seem to work when someone makes a wild miscalculation in judgement.

Either you're pitching a fight you think you'll lose, risking sizeable physical and financial harm for ""honor"".  Or you're positing a conflict that's wildly stacked in one participant's favor, foisting the sizeable physical and financial costs onto a single (presumably unwitting) party.

In what scenario does this fight proceed?  Certainly not a fair one.

Nothing was said about employment or business. You're assigning definitions that do not necessarily apply. ""Incapacitating [one's] ability to operate"" need not mean rendering them incapable of employment. It means nothing more than it states: removing an ability to function in an operational capacity. No parameter has been defined about *what* the hypothetical operation might entail. For an (extremely obtuse) example, one might remove another's ability to operate as a threat by breaking their arm, but have no lasting impact on their employability. 

We're getting away from the core question here, which concerned the legality of consenting adults to duel. I believe that complete immunity from legal repercussion does not exist, but I do think that the specific legality involved is contingent on the outcome of the duel...and I also aver that not every duel need by definition result in death.",Anarcho_Capitalism,3,1546546743.0,comment

This assumes that protections are expensive, which is untrue. You can buy dashcams for less than $100. Neighborhood Watch is also cheap and effective. There are charity legal centers already, and many lawyers work bro bono, or offer their services for free (up front) in exchange for a portion of any winnings afterwards.

When it comes to private courts/law, I'd imagine a DRO or LegalZoom type company could significantly bring down costs associated with legal/justice matters. Companies like Walmart and Dollar Tree cater to poor people with lots of success, so I'd think these types of services would be expanded in the absence of a government (which, by the way, *routinely* fucks over poor people FAR worse than anyone else).

dbeji16,"> Donald Trump has obtained the required 270 electoral votes to become president.
Although electors in dozens of states still have to vote, the electoral balloting in Texas put Trump over the majority threshold, according to a state-by-state tally by the Associated Press. Thirty-six of the state's electors voted for Trump, one for John Kasich and one for Ron Paul.

> The next, and last, official step in the electoral process is for Congress to count the votes. Under the procedure set out by the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, that formal process is scheduled for Jan. 6.
Some anti-Trump activists had hoped against hope that they could persuade electors in states that voted for Trump to defect, but their efforts were unsuccessful.

> Electors are nearly all party loyalists. Additionally, they faced more than two centuries of tradition and, in some states, legal obligations that called for them to cast their ballots according to which candidate won the popular vote in their states. No defectors have ever changed the result of a presidential election.

> Four electors today successfully defected in Washington state. Instead of voting for Hillary Clinton, who won the state's popular vote, three electors voted for former secretary of State Colin Powell and one voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, an environmental activist. Electors in two other states who tried to vote against the state's winner were replaced with alternates. There may be additional defections in the remaining states, but since Trump now has a majority of the electoral votes, those would not be enough to change the result.",Anarcho_Capitalism,8,1482194655.0,comment

dbf520r,"I'd argue that the poor get thrown to the grinder as a byproduct of capitalism, not as its direct aim. Under capitalism, the bottom line is King, all other considerations are secondary - workers rights, health and safety, environmental protections etc etc, all had to legislated for *because* the captains of industry exploited the living shit out of their workforce. Without a government telling Company A not to dump untreated waste, or force its employees to take the weekends off, Company A *will* dump its untreated waste, and it *will* make its staff work for as long as its profitable. History has shown us this in countless situations across the globe.

Capitalism was a vast improvement over feudalism, but it comes with its own problems and contradictions. It produces an economic elite who horde an obscene amount of wealth while offering nothing in return, just like a monarch under feudalism. The increasing divide between the rich and the poor is another symptom of capitalism, a symptom that would be exacerbated by removing regulations on industry. Free Market 'Libertarian' capitalism proposes that we surrender our safety net to the free market, where a profit driven body will somehow provide an altruistic service.

The wealth we have today is a result of a great many things, imperialism, slavery, (classic) liberalism, capitalism,  communism, war, advances in technology which allow for even greater advances at a faster pace, advances in medicine which give us a greater quality of life etc etc.

There is no way you can attribute it all to one economic model that has only been the dominant model for c.200 years. It important to remember that the widespread adaption of capitalism came at the same time as massive advances in transport, electricity and steam power, which would have happened under any economic system.",Anarcho_Capitalism,-1,1482236633.0,comment

The goal of any society shouldn't be to make sure that homeless can sleep on benches unmolested by the police, we produce enough wealth to make sure that no one has to be homeless, or hungry, or go without medical care. Roman Abramavoich can spend what most would consider a good years wages on[ lunch for him and a few friends](http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2009/11/02/roman-abramovichs-52000-lunch-bill/). The same man can [buy himself a toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_\(yacht\)) that you or I would have to work *ten thousand years* to be able to afford. So excuse me for not agreeing that I'd be better off if i left my welfare in the hands the Kochs and Abramaovichs of this world. When we produce this much wealth, we can afford to house everyone on the planet, to feed them, and to make sure they have a better quality of life than any of their ancestors, yet our current model allows, even encourages, the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a tiny section that do nothing to earn it.

Staying with your example of park benches, and excuse me for engaging in a bit of reductio ad absurdum, but who exactly would own the park benches that the homeless are sleeping on? With the state in an ideal anarcho-capitalist society not having the remit to tax businesses and individuals in order provide intangible services like parks, will privates businesses and individuals pool their resources to provide public spaces for others to enjoy for free. And If they do, will they see homeless people as unlucky chaps that need a place to stay, or trespassers in violation of the NAP?

The government in the USA might do a piss poor job of helping poor people, but even its most basic provisions are better than nothing. Obamacare is preferable to untreated cancer, food stamps are better than an empty stomach, and a free education in a shit school is preferable to a childhood spent in a manufacturing or farming job. There are no examples, either historical or contemporary, that lead me to believe that unregulated capitalism would be better for the working class than the current system.

You should not defend yourself on the street *as the cop is beating you senseless*, you should instead defend yourself in court, because that is what good, honest citizens do: go to court where the cops will lie under oath and where corrupt prosecutors will bend over backwards to defend dirty cops, up to and including lying to you, lying to the public, lying to the judge, hiding or destroying exculpatory evidence or possibly even fabricating damning evidence. Court, where complicit judges will also help further tilt the tables against you by denying you the ability to introduce exculpatory evidence and always taking police officers at their word.""---bootlicking conservatives.

It didn’t matter, they still handcuffed him and allowed that cops friends beat him half to death while he was cuffed, funny thing is, he still sent one of them to the hospital.

So, for every victim thinking they were running to their hero that's here to save them, the police feared for their lives and gunned down the same citizens that thought they were going to survive the gunman's shooting spree back inside the building. 

The mainstream media propaganda is that cops' work to protect us but courts have ruled their job is only to enforce the law. If you ever feel protected, that was an incidental side effect of them enforcing the law. At that nightclub, they came to kill a gunman and everyone that got in their way was collateral damage.

There was bodycam video which provided objective documentation of an event to which only 5 police officers and the man they murdered were witness. ~~Without that video, the jury had to rely entirely on what the cops say happened, with the person they killed being unable to say ""No, they're lying."" The video shows exactly what happened; that video, the single most important piece of evidence in the entire trial, was withheld from the jury by the prosecutor and the police department and a judge approved it.~~

Edit: the jury in fact *did* see the video, or at least a portion of it, but the Judge *did* withhold from the Jury the fact that Brailsford, the officer who killed Daniel Shaver, had ""You're Fucked"" [on the ejection port of his duty rifle,](https://imgur.com/yM21Jt9) the weapon he used to kill his victim.

So unless you've got a source confirming a high share of those cop killings were from blacks, this is bullshit.

None of it is even close to an excuse for cops to be the racist pussies that they are. Which, by the way, they chose their job. They should either be good at it without whining and attacking in fear, or quit.   

Also funny how you grab 3 numbers, and use the lowest rather than the median or the mean.

""they were reaching"" shouldn't be an excuse to murder someone. that's the entire point of this post. the point that cops get to use the slightest excuse to justify killing someone, while their victims are burdened with the expectation of acting perfectly compliant and not making mistakes.

>It is real simple do exactly what the man with the authority and the gun tells you, answer their questions and dont smart off and you will live to see another day

did you watch the Daniel Shaver video? Explain to me how you can watch that video, and say ""just follow their instructions""

also, again, THAT is exactly the point of this post. unarmed untrained civilians are expected to act perfectly while being yelled at with guns pointed at their heads, with the expectation of ""do exactly what the man tells you or else you will die"", meanwhile cops can make mistakes and it's always ""oh well, it's a hard job, they're under stress, he was afraid for his life, boo hoo"".

why do you think it's ok for cops to shoot people just for making a slight mistake or not obeying (sometimes conflicting) orders perfectly? Why do you think it's ok to say ""they were reaching, therefore they got shot"" or ""do exactly what he tells you, answer their question, and we won't murder you""??

that's what criminal gangs, muggers, and the mafia do. When you get mugged by some gang bangers, you just do what they tell you to do, hand over your wallet, don't act tough, and hopefully they won't shoot you. cool.",Anarcho_Capitalism,2,1549982177.0,comment

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/09/are-black-or-white-offenders-more-likely-to-kill-police/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.3a5c6f0eaa5d Based on the FBI database over a decade (not current numbers, but long term trends are more meaningful anyway), 41% of cops are killed by blacks and 52% are killed by whites. So, estimate, it'd be 26 for that year in particular. 26 killings done by 14 million people vs 16 killings done by 900,000. Ratio is even worse in most other years, as the above commenter intentionally used the decade-long low number of cops killing blacks to make the best example.      

What can we gather?   
1. Cops are the most violent and deadly group per capita, by far.   
2. Cops are more than 16.53 times more likely to kill anyone than they are to be killed.   
3. Cops are more likely to be killed by whites than blacks, and are incredibly unlikely to be killed by any other ethnic group.   
4. People who talk about how anti-statist they are while being cop apologists and pretending that voting for a major political party is anti-statist are a joke. ",Anarcho_Capitalism,3,1549913851.0,comment

egbf7vo,">SO the cop should just wait and get shot before actually pulling his gun and protecting himself ?

huh?

presumably they already have their guns out. and if they have their guns out, yeah maybe they SHOULD wait until they actually get shot at to justify them shooting back. Our soldiers who get deployed into warzones in Iraq or Afghanistan have to follow ROE's that don't let them shoot unless fired upon first, why can't cops follow similar rules? soldiers can follow those ROE's in a foreign country that is currently a civil war, but cops can't follow those ROE's in their own town among civilians? please.

cops like to use the ""muh dangerous job, we risk our lives every day"" excuse to garner sympathy (despite being a safer job than things like truck driver, construction worker, miner, etc), well maybe they should be risking their lives instead of shooting first and asking questions later. They can't have it both ways. You can't brag about risking your life, but then say that you get to shoot people if they so much as flinch in the wrong direction because you were afraid for your life.

>You left out the cop who shot him was charged with 2nd degree murder . 

lol and he was acquitted. woop de doo.

>Cops aren't perfect but being ass while being detained and resisting arrest is stupid. I'm not advocating that people resist arrest you idiot.

people like Daniel Shaver weren't being an ass and they weren't resisting arrest.

also, 'being an ass' shouldn't justify the cop using lethal force. 'reaching' AKA 'moving your arm' shouldn't be justification for an armed agent of the state to shoot you in the head.

>which I am betting you will figure out in your last seconds of life after being shot by a cop for resisting or reaching. While you take your last breath think about whether it was worth it or not as you DIE

ega737j,"Hi, I am currently enrolled in law school and I would like to apply my not yet complete education. You posted a lot of articles and I want to read and respond to all of them. This is going to be massive. Sorry

Article 1: I did not see anywhere in the article that the video of the shooting was withheld from the trial or the jury. The article stated that the video was not released to the media or the family for fear that the family would go on a news show and describe the video. I saw nothing to suggest this evidence could not be used in court. This is a GOOD thing. If the video was released to the public and the verdict went against this murdering cop he would have a solid argument at the appellate level that the jury was unduly prejudiced. In such a case the verdict would be overturned and the cop would either be free with no consequences or the case would be sent back to be retried and the family would have to deal with going through a trial again

Article 2: it’s a good thing that everyone has a phone now. As the article states video is a great defense to testalying.Phones are great because everyone has a camera and instances of blatant lying are more likely to be rebutted by existing video. There are some shitty cops. There are some cops who took the job to abuse their power. There are some uber drivers who do it as a side gig to take sexual advantage of drunk people. There are some surgeons who have killed people by coming to work drunk (alcohol abuse is significantly greater than normal in the medical and legal communities) there are some shitbag lawyers who lie and squeeze money out of fake cases. Sucks that there are bad people with the power cops have but that’s just how things are. I’m not sure how to make them better.

Article 3: this might be article 2. I’ve been writing, deleting and rewriting for a while now. I’m referring to the article which explains New York is in the minority (1 of 10 states) that lets prosecutors wait to turn over exculpatory evidence until after a plea deal. While making the personal decision about falsely pleading guilty to reduce your jail time must be horrible if there is exculpatory evidence and if is turned over the plea can be overturned. There are procedures in place to overturn a false plea. (This could happen for a number of reasons like the person giving the plea is mentally ill or the prosecutor trumped up the evidence and so on) 
The article mentions the N.Y. rule (I’m not studying NY law so I do not know it’s specifics) that upon filing for discover of exculpatory evidence the prosecutor missed the deadline to respond. A lawyer like a doctor has to have a license to practice the profession. In order to continue having a license a lawyer must comply with ethical rules. If a prosecutor fails to comply with the law then file an ethics complaint to the state BAR. This threatens his ability to keep practicing law ie his livelihood. I guarantee the fucker responds to the exculpatory evidence request after the ethics committee gets after him

Edit: to read and respond to the other articles

Article 4: I cannot call the abuses of 2 people evidence of rampant systemic abuse. It is terrifying that they influenced 50k cases. Why are people who regularly handle addictive substances not subjected to regular drug tests?

Article 5: yeah privacy is dead. Cops can get away with this shit so long as they are correct and the target is a criminal. I know a lawyer who worked with a defendant on a 4th amendment violation. The cops suspected this person was a drug dealer. The cops dressed up as pizza delivery employees. They came with a pizza. The guy said he didn’t order a pizza. The cops forced entry and found that he was dealing drugs. Judge did not care that the person had his constitutional rights violated because the person was a drug dealer.

Article 6; prosecutors have their careers evaluated by their number of wins or win percentage. This incentivized underhanded/illegal methods to inflate those numbers. Bad incentives create bad behavior

egaekpi,"*sigh*.....why do you have to do this? I'm a busy man as it is...but Lord knows I can't stop myself from taking the bait...

Anyway, on Article 1: it turns out, and I'm glad you brought this to my attention, I had conflated in my memory two different things. You were right to point out that the bodycam footage was not withheld from the jury--they saw at least a portion of the footage--but the video was withheld from the public while the trial was on-going, and I suppose that is justifiable, though I have to wonder how it would prejudice the jury if the public saw the same video the jury saw after the jury had already been selected. But I guess by keeping the video sealed until after the trial it prevents any hint of impropriety in the trial itself, as you point out. 

**However,** a piece of evidence *was* withheld from the jury.  Kept hidden from them was the fact that the officer who fired the fatal shots had etched into the ejection port of his rifle the words ""You're Fucked"" (the significance being that the words would only have been visible if the rifle was fired--you shoot the rifle, the ejection port pops open and, like a perverted jack in the box, the words ""You're Fucked"" appear).

The Judge said such evidence is ""prejudicial""--and though it's a fair question ""Who are you, u/Paperbackwriter66, to argue with a law student?"" but I would indeed ask the law student: isn't *all* evidence prejudicial if the evidence shows the defendant is guilty? 

Of course, that's not the real question; I get that. The real question is whether the evidence is *relevant* to the trial, whether it in fact is evidence of the defendant's guilt or exculpatory evidence, or is instead simply something that makes the defendant unsympathetic to the jury while doing nothing to show guilt or innocence. I get it and I understand why the judge ruled it was prejudicial and not worth admitting into the trial; I happen to think the judge was wrong. 

I would argue that a cop who etches into his official duty weapon a phrase ""You're Fucked"" shows malice aforethought--that this officer was eager to use his weapon against citizens who are, after all, innocent until proven guilty. And since the trial of Brailsford was *centered* on the question of ""Was this officer trigger happy? Was he perhaps not reasonably afraid for his life but was, rather, eager to shoot someone?""--putting ""You're Fucked"" on the dust cover of the ejection port is important evidence the Jury has a right to know. 

Reasonable people can disagree about all that, but here I think is *the* question which would sort reasonable people form unreasonable people: if a private citizen had shot and killed someone under questionable circumstances and claimed self-defense, and then a prosecutor was bringing this to trial as 2nd degree murder, would the same judge exclude from the jury the fact that the defendant had etched into his personal weapon ""You're Fucked""? I'm not so sure. But if we say yes, the judge would have done the same for a private citizen acting privately what the judge did for a public police officer acting officially, that then begs a 2nd question: if we are merely holding police officers to the *same* standard as private citizens...why aren't we holding police officers to a *higher* standard?

On Article 2: I'll simply say that it indicates a very serious problem with the culture of police departments when cops are either so brazen or so stupid they think they can continue to get away with lying under oath *even when they know that everyone has cameras all the time* and the chances of being able to get away with lying are becoming ever slimmer. 

Hopefully this problem corrects itself and police officers see the error of their ways, but I hope you can forgive me for being a bit cynical and thinking that police will just find cleverer ways of lying and not getting caught.

The overriding point I was trying to make, however, is that this is a widespread, *systemic* problem, where police lie in court because they know the judge and prosecutor and often the jury will simply take them at their word (""Police would never lie!"") and, until recently, there was almost no way of proving the police were in fact lying. Maybe this is beginning to change, but for the moment it remains a problem--and, I would add, a serious problem for any innocent defendant who, if put in a situation where it is their word against the word of a cop or multiple cops, the defendant is not lucky enough to have a recording of the incident in question.

>A lawyer like a doctor has to have a license to practice the profession. In order to continue having a license a lawyer must comply with ethical rules. If a prosecutor fails to comply with the law then file an ethics complaint to the state BAR.

Except prosecutors have a thing called ""absolute immunity"". As the name implies, it is absolute. Now, as you point out, an aberrant prosecutor could potentially be disbarred, but as [this article persuasively argues](https://reason.com/blog/2015/03/09/the-problem-with-prosecutorial-immunity), that can be rather light punishment for someone who has the power to ruin or even potentially end lives.

At the very least, prosecutors should be liable in civil court for the damages they cause *even when acting in an official capacity.* That, I'm sure you would agree, would be quite a disincentive against fraudulent or outright criminal behavior, to say nothing of unethical behavior.

As for the rest, it seems you are largely agreeing with me. On the point of the crooked evidence lab technicians, I would just point out that while it was just 2 people in one state, they *did* affect tens of thousands of cases. That can't be dismissed out of hand as ""just two people"", especially when similar incidents have occurred elsewhere. I'll give you multiple sources for that claim:

John Stossel on forensic evidence being revealed as junk science by DNA evidence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoyNZPLYBW0

(forgive the Youtube video, which I recognize is not the most rigorous of sources, but the information is accurate and I thought it would be courteous to give you a Youtube video for ease of consumption).

The Innocence Project saying much the same: https://www.innocenceproject.org/causes/misapplication-forensic-science/

And a point about the above: sure, this may not indicate malicious intent on the part of the government, since many people wrongfully imprisoned because of bad forensic evidence were locked up because of an honest mistake in the lab or a misinterpretation of what the evidence meant (often by the jury), but regardless of whether it is intentionally on the part of the government, it is still a *problem* that many innocent people are wrongfully imprisoned, in whole or in part, on the basis of bad evidence. And it reflects poorly on the government and prosecutors that they pushed this bad evidence for many years and in some cases continue to push it.

But then sometimes there *is* deliberate malice on the part of the government, as one whistleblower revealed to the public: rampant fraud in the FBI's forensic labs. 

Source: https://www.whistleblowersblog.org/2017/11/articles/intelligence-community-whistleblowers/dr-whitehurst-and-the-fbi-lab-scandal/



>This incentivized underhanded/illegal methods to inflate those numbers. Bad incentives create bad behavior

Agreed. Which is why I would potentially support an amendment to the Constitution (or the my home state's Constitution) to either make prosecutors an un-elected position or to prohibit anyone who has been an elected prosecutor from running for higher office.

>Also Harris is a piece of shit.

Indeed, but I didn't highlight her merely to further embarrass her and tar her reputation. Well, that's not the *only* reason I highlighted her. It's because she is not atypical, she is representative of prosecutors.

eh0c52c,"""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need""

Those that have more abilities don't necessarily have greater needs than those with lesser abilities.

Why take time/effort/money to expand your abilities if you are only rewarded based upon your needs?

What place do individual liberties have in Communism? Who determines the job that you will ultimately have?

The most successful communist system thus far has been the Soviet Union, I'd argue that the only reason it had that success was due to the violent oppression of its citizens to will it into being. It also resulted in the deaths of millions due to famine.

I think the major flaw in Communism theory is that it assumes that everyone is moral and benevolent. 

When in reality history shows this to not be the case, resulting in the system being used to oppress those without political power while strengthening those that do. It doesn't account for human traits such as greed, and immorality. 

There are many examples of this over the past 100 years. Look at Stalin, Pol Pot, The Kim's of Korea etc. In every one of those communistic systems class systems still evolved, often based on your relationship with the government. While everyone else was equally dirt poor waiting in line for their meal ration.

In a perfect utopia of it might work but unfortunately that is not the nature of Homo Sapiens. There's a reason we are here and others like the Cro-magnon, and Neanderthals are not. We out-competed/killed them which is why societies that promote competition have been very successful while those that do not have tended to languish.

Sure you can argue that those weren't true communist systems but i'd also argue that there aren't any true capitalist societies today either as early all governments have some level of socialism built in. Foodstamps, medicaid, Social Security in the US. The NHS in the UK etc. Additionally nearly all countries (99%) have a central bank which heavily regulates the flow of capital throughout society. 

A central bank is anti-capitalistic in nature as there are no freely competing currencies with the central bank and the central bank determines interest rates in a planned manner, not by free market mechanisms. If you think the US is a capitalist society i'd implore you to do more research, [The US said goodbye to true capitalism and the free market in 1913.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act)

Throughout history the greatest increases of economic capabilities and standards of living have occurred under periods of limited regulated capitalism, as it is more in line with our competitive nature, and the laws of nature in general where only the strongest/cleverest/opportunistic/driven survive. 

It's that drive for improvement for yourself and family that has made us the dominant species on the planet. It's what drove early humans to look for new lands and better opportunities. If the tribe across the river had more abundant resources than you and was thriving we went across that river and tried to take it from them. This is something inherent in nearly all living creatures today, there's countless examples in the animal kingdom. Communism does not mesh with this inherent animal desire.

I've read Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky. I've researched the Russian revolution as well as other communistic revolutions and their systems. I understand that my examples may not be those of true communist societies as Marx had envisioned but they are the closest representations that we have had. I don't think human nature is capable of achieving a true communist society, our natural animal instincts will always get in the way of this.

Have you taken the time to read Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and other proponents of the Austrian School of Economics?

Trust me, there was a time when I was younger that I would have agreed with you. 

But life experiences and an acquired fascination with human history has changed my view over the years. I believe a free market system works best, where the only Government involvement is to restrict anti-competitive practices for all such as breaking up monopolies, organized price fixing, etc. and I can point to countless examples throughout history where this is true.",Anarcho_Capitalism,1,1550809973.0,comment

eqt4fm2,"**Holodomor**

The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р; derived from морити голодом, ""to kill by starvation"") was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine, and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine or The Ukrainian Genocide of 1932–33. It was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–33, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. During the Holodomor, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine.

***

**Great Chinese Famine**

The Great Chinese Famine (Chinese: 三年大饑荒, ""three years of famine"") was a period in the People's Republic of China between the years 1959 and 1961 characterized by widespread famine. The policies of ruler Mao Zedong contributed to the famine, although the relative weights of the contributions are disputed.  Estimates of deaths due to starvation range in the tens of millions.

egiaj3t,"Okay, so I watched the first video, and the first point he makes regards the tweet: ""Color doesn't matter. Ideology does."" James then argues how linked color/nationality is to political ideology... which I know Ben agrees with because I've heard him say just that. He was simply making a distinction that it is not specifically the color that is the problem, since he gets called a racist quite often. I get the sense that James is dumbing Ben down in order to make a point.

He then talks about how Ben views the US as an economic zone, and not a people unified under the same culture and traditions. This couldn't be further from the truth. Ben talks about that constantly, stressing the importance of a unified culture. That's not mutually exclusive with prioritizing economically successful immigrants, no matter the country they're emigrating from.

Then he moves onto Israel, where he decides to pretend that Ben Shapiro's opinions haven't evolved since he was in his early 20's. This is again, something Ben says a lot, that his views HAVE evolved significantly since then, and he has publicly retracted many of them, especially concerning Israel. If James has to reach that far back to make a point, I question how intellectually honest he's actually trying to be. I haven't heard Ben advocate the transfer of Arab populations in Israel at all. In fact, I've heard him celebrate the fact that Israel allows Arabs to immigrate, contrasting the Israeli tolerance to the absolute intolerance of the Arab world at the idea of Jews immigrating.

And I do find it quite silly to call Ben a hypocrite for stating a clear reality, which is that Israelis and Palestinians cannot coexist side by side. No one disputes that. Is James pretending as if all cultures are as hostile as the Israelis and the Palestinians? Literally one of, if not THE, most hostile two cultures in the world?

Not impressed.

The second video, by the Squatting Slav, similarly dumbs Ben down. He uses the term ""identity politics"" loosely, as to make Ben seem hypocritical. I could almost hear Ben in my head responding to his cheap points, and I know that he would begin refining the Squatting Slav's definition of identity politics. Ben believes that Jews deserve a homeland where it is currently located. That does not mean that Israel is just for jews, as it clearly isn't. They allow for immigration of Arab Muslims for example, and Ben has never criticized this. In fact, he celebrates how western Israel is, as a sharp contrast to the surrounding region. And then the Slav says something ridiculous along the lines of, ""then why not white identity politics?"" Ben has never endorsed specifically racial identity politics, and, as the Slav correctly states, fights it quite firmly. Perhaps the Slav must be reminded that you don't have to be ethnically Jewish in order to be religiously Jewish. Ben's wife is a Moroccan Jew, in fact. So how is Ben a hypocrite again? And racial identity politics, which the Slav seems to defend, is a great way to divide a country, something James (in the previous video) seems concerned about.

The Stefan video doesn't seem to address Ben Shapiro specifically, at least by the looks of it, and is rather exposing the hypocrisy in other Jews who may have less thought-out political philosophies.

So let me know what you think about my response if you'd like. I could be wrong, but I'd need some counter evidence. Those videos were not convincing in the slightest to me, who knows Ben very well. And I may come across as a Shapiro fanboy, but I'm not even conservative. I just believe in giving people fair representation, which is hard to come by in videos like those where the intent is to criticize. It's much easier to dumb your opponent down.

egih4ui,"1. Communism is a collectivist political system that seeks to create equality of outcome for the collective. It involves state force to redistribute goods and resources according to the blind guesses of the states central planners. (I didn’t look it up btw). 

2. I agree with you that the 2008 recession was terrible and was caused by the mismanagement of banks. However you need to recognize that the reason we had such terrible mismanagement by the banks was because of governments involvement in the banks in the first place. When the Federal Reserve did “quantitative easing” and artificially lowered interest rates, bypassing the market savings needed to lower real market based interest rates, they created a terrible bubble that blew in 2008, beginning the liquidation of all the misallocations caused by the terrible loans banks had given out as a result of the low interest rates. Banks among many other companies like GM failed as a result and then the government in all its infinite wisdom bailed them out, when they should have let them fail, so that more efficient companies could buy them out at a cheaper price and use them more efficiently. Get rid of government and it’s interference in the economy and you won’t have the boom/bust cycle we have, and real economic growth can be created.

3. How does some central planner in a government, who’s never met me, and probably lives far away from me have my best interests in mind? That’s pretty much what communism is. With a free market I am able to not participate in purchasing from someone or working for someone and can go help their competitors if they do not provide for my self-interests.

Yes, because in 1947, [Jews owned 7% of Mandatory Palestine](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Palestine_Index_to_Villages_and_Settlements%2C_showing_Land_in_Jewish_Possession_as_at_31.12.44.jpg), whilst the rest was under possession of Arabs, as [stated under section 164 of the UNSCOP report](https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3). So tell me, what was the justification given by Israel to claim the private and public property of Palestinians?

2000 year old ethnicity? Let's see if this holds up in any situation. Alright. I'm a Persian Jew in Norway, and I own land in Norway. Clearly I am not 'ethnically Norwegian'. Is a Minnesotan with Norwegian ethnicity allowed to claim my property?

Second of all as for venezuela, remember that the existence of a communist world would require international cooperation from all other states, resulting in dissolution of a state, etc. However we must consider that the United States doesn't exactly want this to happen for some pretty obvious reasons. So, as for your trading with the US argument, we must consider a wider spectrum. The US is a global hegemon and has their hands tied in most global trade, etc. So, if they're to impose sanctions on you, no matter what, you're basicall screwed. This is again forgetting that the good ol' venezuela argument is forgetting that a UK bank literally withheld funds from the venezuelan government, thus making development impossible. I'd like to see any free market system try to function well in the absence of funding to do so. And if venezuela were to step away from the US, as has essentially happened, cool guess what. The US backed the fascist Guadio's coup, so if you don'y cooperate with them, they'll essentially force you to do so by means of regime change, so they're stuck between a rock and a hard place here. This tactic is well documented throughout US post-war foreign policy. So I think that the answer you're looking for isn't as simplistic as this one root cause you look for.

Yes, but that's the aticle from the view that Ben wrote when he was in his early 20's. My point was that many of his opinions regarding Israel have changed since then, and he says so himself. Additionally, I have never heard him advocate for the transfer of Arab populations other than in this article. So I'm criticizing James for reaching in order to make a point. But you're right, IF Ben endorsed this still, he'd be hypocritical, unless he was able to provide a line of reasoning which isn't clear from where we're standing.

They immigration policy simply doesn't restrict Arab muslims from immigrating. And there's a decent amount of muslims in Israel. I can't really prove a negative in a short and sweet manner. If you want to prove it, go ahead.

> So tell me, what was the justification given by Israel to claim the private and public property of Palestinians?

Are you saying that Israel has no right to exist anywhere in the region, or are you criticizing their further encroachments? It seems like the former. You make a thought provoking point. Perhaps the method in which Israel came to being is unjust. But lets imagine that no state force was used, and Jew in the wake of the holocaust, voluntarily moved to the region, not by stealing property, but by settling unused land. Do you think the Palestinians would've acted any differently? The Jews are fine living side by side Palestinians. It's the Palestinians that want to coerce the Jews into nonexistence. That's not to excuse Israels forceful actions either, but do you think Israel would've even acted that way had the Arab world not tried to certificate them right away?

> Are you saying

I'm saying if Israel wants to exist, they can only exist on land they own. Which was 7% in 1947. [This is what they own](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Palestine_Index_to_Villages_and_Settlements%2C_showing_Land_in_Jewish_Possession_as_at_31.12.44.jpg).

> let's imagine [...] not by stealing property, but by settling unused land

We don't need to. 1880 to 1947 was the period when they did this. They used to by land from land owners. That's perfectly alright.

But let me pose you the same question, would you be alright, if as long as Mexicans are not stealing your property, but settling on unused land in America - is that alright? The Mexicans are fine living side by side with Americans, it's only the Americans that fear the Mexicans. Would you object? Why? Now apply the same principles to others.

However, I'll call you out on trying to make it seem like they wanted to integrate as Palestinians. They did not. They wanted their own state. Pray tell, why did Golda Meir, who had a Palestinian passport, feel she needed to create a new nation within one that had let her in as their own?

Back to the Mexicans. Hypothetically, you let them live on all the land you don't own. Now they claim they want to make a new nation that fragments America, call it New New Mexico. Do you think Americans would be alright with that? Why?

With that in mind, we have spent the last few months taking a hard look at our past and coming communication and reflecting on the types of men and behaviors we want to celebrate. We’re inviting all men along this journey with us – to strive to be better, to make us better, and to help each other be better.

The video add doesn't just make white people look bad, it is suggesting that somehow allowing children to play fight is causing violence against women. That the way men raise their children is a problem that causes violence, sexual assalut, and even rape. That coddling young boys that are bullied instead of teaching them to stand up for themselves is virtuous. That noticing a woman is pretty and wanting to talk to her is ""not cool, bro"". That men in positions of authority patronize women and don't show them respect BECAUSE they are women. Really bosses explain things to people because it's their job to do so. In my experience men are more critical of each other than they are of woman. woman tend to criticize privately so when they are critized publicly it's more tramutic for them and they perceive sexism that isn't there. Also it's just 1 more add out of thousands of cultural messaging putting women on a pedestal and men in the hot seat.

You've just contradicted yourself and given incontrovertible evidence that toxic masculinity exists.  Parenting choices like being completely absent are too common among some men, and cause huge problems.

I'm not saying we cede the culture war, that would be foolish.  But overreacting to things like this does feel a lot like the left's hyper-vigilance to racial dog-whistles.  Instead of hyperventilating, and giving them more reason to call us racist, sexist bullies, IMO, we should save the indignation for the clear, obvious differences, and things like this should be damned with faint praise and largely ignored.

We can't laugh it off. [Insert footage of a cook dropping food on the floor and putting it back on the plate], making the same old excuses [insert footage of a cook smoking and scratching their ass]  'Cooks will be cooks'. But something finally changed.. and there will be no going back. Because we, believe in the best in cooks.  [Insert footage of celebrity - 'We need to start holding cooks accountable!'] ..."" , etc.

In other words, it wouldn't be saying that ""some cooks"" are giving the rest of them a bad name, it's saying that a majority of cooks are doing bad things and that these disgusting things ""have become normal"", when in reality they haven't. The majority of cooks know better, and when they catch other cooks being disgusting slobs, they call them out on it.

>""To say the right thing, to act the right way. *Some* already are... in ways big and small.. *but some is not enough*""

You're getting very defensive over a few statistics. Seems like you're literally shaking...relax, you'll give yourself a headache. All I'm saying is that the countries that outrank the United States are certainly not ""tyrannical shitholes"". It would be absurd to think otherwise.

They do, however, have several things in common - all of them have far greater equality than the United States. Now, you can choose to ignore that fact all you want because it might not suit your ideological narrative after the indoctrination but I'm telling you that a better life *is* achievable the further you move *away* (and not towards) the kind of neoliberal policies the United States so dearly ""spreads"" around the world.",Anarcho_Capitalism,-21,1542051083.0,comment

They called them selves socialists. they were inspired by marx and lenin. They had socialist policies. The third reich nazi's were by the book socialists in every way. Nazi's are what socialism is, raw pure socialism, implemented exactly as intended.

The results are different than what was advertised; that is the only discrepancy. Socialism makes false promises; while capitalism promises nothing in specific.

This is even on wikipedia; its easy to find. they has a national retirement plan, nationalization of industries, government controlled military, gun control, laws against a free press, central banking, heavy industry regulation, wage laws, etc etc.

Except for the nationalism and pro-white identity politics, its the same as modern socialism. 

> socialist movement by prominent socialists

Have you not heard of Norman Thomas, Lawrence Dennis, Ezra Pound, Alfred Richard Orage, and essentially the core of american media and socialist/communist parties at the time were either split between russian and german style socialism, or vaguely supportive of both and opposed to the US entry into WW2 or support of the UK.

This is not secret information; although their are countless attempts to rewrite history after the war. the left has tried so hard to rewrite history that george orwell remarked: ""The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable'”

ehq51jh,"One of my friend’s boyfriends is a very vocal communist. He is nineteen.

I see it this way. Everyone will fall on a spectrum. At one end of that spectrum he is a once in a generation political genius who has discovered a way to make an ideology that has killed more people than the Nazis work. He is motivated entirely by generosity of spirit and logic. 

At the other end of that spectrum he is nothing more than a mugger with delusions of grandeur. He advocates violent crime, but is too much of a coward to go commit it himself. Instead he tries to whip up a mob to help him.

One of the ways of determining where people fall on this scale is how much their ideology requires them to sacrifice, and how much it emboldens them to take.

He lives in the first world, and his parents straddle the line between upper middle class and rich. Large family home, holiday house at the beach. He owns a motorbike and jet ski, but has never held a job. His belief system has never required him to give a single thing he owns to the 98% of people in the world who have it worse. But he often talks about how his communist friends will kill the rich and take what was stolen from them. When I ask him who he is talking about specifically, he can’t give any names. The people deserving of death are anyone with more money than his family, who he doesn’t personally know.

My friend, his girlfriend, has suffered an incredibly abusive background. She lives on a state welfare payment that realistically doesn’t provide for her basic needs. She genuinely loves him, despite his being a turd of a boyfriend. His grandmother died recently and he inherited a decent chunk of change.

I dropped her off things like pasta, canned food and suchlike before Christmas because her housemate had gone overseas and she doesn’t drive. She literally had no food in the house and no way to get any.

I think that depends on how you define ""rigged"".  NC's House race clearly indicates that the GOP is playing fast and loose with election laws.  But the RNC clearly didn't want Trump at the top of the ticket in 2016.  The crooked electioneering is happening at the local level.  It's not something the party can coordinate nationally, without huge risks.

I wouldn't be surprised if pro-Trump county level leadership *was* rigging elections, just in favor of Trump, during the primary.  At the same time, I don't know how much of that mattered relative to the natural groundswell of support he enjoyed.

ehmfd5o,"So where does this 5 trillion come from (even though every single news source I have checked [fortune, fox, townhall, bloomberg, breitbart, reason, etc] says 90-93 trillion, but I’ll give you benefit of the doubt)? Trump decided where he wants the money from and it’s reasonable because of that (not that I support the wall but it’s a far better plan than the GND, which saddens me as Trump has quite the low IQ compared to AOC).

I feel that you have not completely researched your sources as Forbes says “Just these six of AOC’s long list of aspirations would then roughly cost some $2.5 trillion a year. Since Washington’s 2018 budget put spending at $4.5 trillion, the Deal would effectively increase federal spending by a touch over half again. That is a hefty price tag, considerably more than the estimated $700 billion a year that would emerge from AOC’s proposal to raise the maximum tax rate to 70%.”

As for the whole oil thing you’re talking about, that would all be solved by affordable solar. Oil has little competition on the market as it’s the only affordable and available energy source that’s in high demand. If you read my last comment I call for an investment in solar energy to make it affordable for all, this driving oil to lower their prices. With the already scares supply of oil, it would be driven to the ground as most people want to help the environment.

Sure.  You can hobble a stallion and it'll still outrace a bent mule.  The demand for Trump dwarfed that of the other candidates, despite intervention.  At the same time, Trump's loyalists could well have hobbled Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich in turn.

Ron Paul never had a real base within the GOP.  He was anti-war in a party that was pro-war.  He rallied against the Fed in a party loyal to Wall Street.  And he repeatedly promised to end entitlements, a third rail in modern politics that has slain bigger figures than humble House Reps.

No, you didn't. You mentioned that you see a single thing as more than black and white. It doesn't contradict what I said, because I was pointing out that your accusation was exactly what you were complaining about. You said that Libertarians don't see nuance or complexity, which is an opinion without nuance or complexity. 

You didn't address what I said, let alone contradict it.

The senate didn’t flip because only 9 Republican seats were up but 26 Democratic seats were up. That’s a lot of chances for Dems to lose seats but only a few chances to gain seats.

Most of these policies will benefit people who work. Many of these programs will actually reduce cost for the average American. 

For example Americans spend twice as much on healthcare than other developed nations with government managed healthcare systems. 

Sauce: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita?wprov=sfti1

With that being the case, how can the U.S. not afford to reform its healthcare system to be in line with other developed nations?

The cost of higher education is also out of control, how many working parents are concerned about how they will pay for their children to go to college? How many young people are currently unable to fully participate in the economy because of crippling student loan debt?

Finally much of the increased costs to the government can be paid for by a top marginal tax rate. A top marginal tax rate will encourage top earners to invest their money rather than hoard it (maybe into better wages).

Anything else that you’re curious about?

Scroll up- you can find comments that simply state AOC’s educational background and link to her wiki....no insults, no snark...and it is just downvoted. That IS pathetic. I’m not gonna sugar coat that. And if I did, like if I said it is “sad”, or “unfortunate” that we can’t engage in healthy debate, or if I simply pointed it out without an adjective, I’m confident I’d receive the same treatment.

It works on young people who work minimum wage and have a hatred of the rich, but you aren't going to convince the middle class Democrats to vote for a rich champagne Socialist that will probably just make the situation work.

Is student loan debt a problem? Yes. Is taxing everyone more to pay for it the solution? I don't think so.

He describes how the over-protecting of children and these self-victimizing movements on college campuses are essentially mass-popularizing typical symptoms of depression and have perpetuated symptoms to yield mentally weaker, less stable people. He describes three bad lessons being taught to kids that are producing these fragile young adults: 

-What doesn't kill you makes you weaker (you should avoid or be sheltered from anything that could hurt you physically or emotionally)--kids becoming less resilient and able to handle inevitable difficult situations in life

-Always trust your feelings (""I feel offended"")--emotion takes precedent over rational thinking

-us vs them: Life is a battle between good and evil (think of college kids grasping to find some cause to fight and putting that cause way out of proportion to it's actual presence in society)--we develop a tribal mentality from a young age. Nothing new here but you'd think as we progressed, we'd want to move away from it.

ehxr0x7,"Yeah you can't give too much thought to trolls or karma loss.

I'm also an atheist, predictably. I'm aware of the distinction you're talking about, and it leads a lot of people to call themselves ""agnostics"" to avoid being classified as people who positively claim there's no god. I don't think that's very productive; it feels too much like the ol' euphemism treadmill (""idiots"" being called ""retards"" out of kindness, and then retard eventually being replaced by mentally disabled, and so on). ""Atheist"" broken down means ""without god"", so I think it can reasonably apply to both categories you mentioned, and people should just be aware that it can mean either. There are, I think, still a whole lot of self-described atheists who only reject claims about God and don't claim to know that there *cannot* be a god hiding somewhere. In fact, I don't know that I've ever met anyone who claims that god cannot exist. It's not really the point of atheism, which is usually about resisting religion.

There are people in the world who aren't very useful in general and spend a lot of time uselessly tearing down other people's beliefs. I don't think that means that defining yourself in opposition to something is *always* a poisonous, bad thing. Imagine someone in WW2 dedicating themselves to defeating Nazism. Just defeating Nazism isn't a recipe for a fulfilled life, you have to replace it with something better. But that person can be useful doing their destructive part, and others can finish where he started.

ehwax4p,"**Genocide of indigenous peoples**

The genocide of indigenous peoples is the mass destruction of entire communities of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples are understood to be people whose historical and current territory has become occupied by colonial expansion, or the formation of a state by a dominant group such as a colonial power.While the concept of genocide was formulated by Raphael Lemkin in the mid-20th century, the earlier expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires, and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory, frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas, Australia, Africa and Asia. According to Lemkin, colonization was in itself ""intrinsically genocidal"". He saw this genocide as a two-stage process, the first being the destruction of the indigenous population's way of life.

***

**Atlantic slave trade**

The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from central and western Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies especially were dependent on the supply of secure labour for the production of commodity crops, making goods and clothing to sell in Europe.

ehxiv3e,"Okay, so the gist of your argument is ""buyer beware."" This is where advertising and the reality of being poor comes in. Like the communists you claim to hate so much this is where you need to ask yourself ""if it makes so much sense to me why didn't it work?"" For some reason the old saying ""buyer beware"" didn't cut it for all the protestors and unionized workers back in the day. Let's look at why.

So you can just ""look things up"" right? Look them up from where. Advertising is everywhere, and without regulations nobody has to disclose sponsorship or even tell the truth. Companies can use the money they save by ignoring safety on smearing the competition with scathing reviews telling customers how sick their beef made them while paying doctor's to falsify data showing that their own beef is perfectly safe while in reality it's preserved with formaldehyde. Today this blatant lying is medical malpractice and a doctor caught doing this could lose their license. Imagine how confusing the world would be without that? Every product would have studies telling you that the product both does, and doesn't cause cancer and you have no way to tell which ones are real. It'd be information overload and would completely destroy your ability to make an informed decision of any kind.

Not to mention the products that had actual addictive drugs in them. Imagine being thirsty and buying a Coke at a gas station only to become addicted to cocaine. They can literally hook you on the product even if you learn it's bad for you.

Being poor makes all this worse. If you wanna work you gotta have a place to stay which costs money. If you don't want to work in your local coal mine that's a shame they're the only employment around and you can't afford to live somewhere else while you look for a job elsewhere. You are literally trapped. If you want an interesting read on this phenomenon look up ""19th and 20th century company towns."" Many of them didn't even pay the employees in actual money, just company tokens only redeemable at company shops. Nobody would take them anywhere else so you were trapped in the company town. It was basically financial slavery. These tactics are illegal now, and I have no idea what good you think would come from them becoming legal again.",Anarcho_Capitalism,1,1551894463.0,comment

ehxkz3n,"Okay, so first, I would like to make it very clear that I don't hate communists.  I hate the ideology, for the most part.  I think that people who believe it have the best intentions, and I respect that about them.  I just fundamentally disagree with their politics.  

You then said to sit back and think on why it didn't work then.  I would argue that it has a lot to do with technology and values.  We are far more advanced now, and we have very different values than they did.  My current position certainly has problems in places, but so does every other ideology.  I simply believe ancapism or something close to it would be the one I like the most.  

I don't know if you know this, but studies are peer reviewed.  That's just how it is.  They can't get through several studies saying that their product is safe when peer review is a thing.  It would also be revealed if Coca-Cola put cocaine in their drinks nowadays.  The media would cover that story for weeks!  They'd get eyes on their news from all over!  

Companies could certainly hire people to say that other companies are bad, but again, if news came out about that, I certainly wouldn't buy from them anymore.  

You then said that poor people wouldn't be able to find other jobs because companies would essentially enslave them.  If a company tried that the way our news works nowadays, how do you think it would end for them?  I know that it would end very poorly for them.  It's also really easy to get a ride out of town now.  Back then, horses were one of the most common forms of transportation.  Are you unaware of how far we come since then?  

The world is incredibly more advanced today than it was 1-200 years ago.  Ancapism can work much better now.  I'd prefer it over government telling I can't do anything it finds distasteful.  ",Anarcho_Capitalism,1,1551895870.0,comment

ehxnjin,"You say that our values are different today but I don't believe that. I'm sorry maybe I'm just a pecimest but I don't. The entire reason capitalism does work the way it does is because it's natural selection. It only takes one company doing something horrible and profiting from it to change the face of an industry. Business leaders 100 years ago weren't worse people they were just doing what they had to do to compete because the endless push for efficiency that capitalism demands went too far. Government regulation exists to balance that constant demand. If a system is most efficient with poisoned children capitalism will ensure those children get poisoned.

I could go on about modern examples too. Lead in gasoline, car safety standards, drinking water pollution, building safety codes. These are all additional advancements we've had in the last 50 years that are just important as the ones 100 years ago and the market didn't solve those either.

I don't think the introduction of the internet suddenly helped these problems go away. If anything it made things worse because if anybody calls out something as bad another group rallies around the thing and defends it. Controversy marketing is now a tactic so we can't rely on that to destroy bad behavior. I know it might suck, but I'd rather live in a world where the government can tell me some things I can't do than live in a world where corporations have the power to tell me what to do, because in the end of the day that's what would happen with zero regulations.

Okay, so I still fail to see how poisoning your customers will make you money.  If that's what they do, and everyone is consenting to take the poison, I don't see a problem then.  I don't understand how it is that you believe people will only be given the option to take poison.  If your customer dies because of your product, that's a customer that no longer buys your product.  Also, if they bought it unaware and unable to learn of the poison, the company that made it violated the NAP by selling you poison while pretending it was something else.

ednq4un,"I heard about it on JRE? It’s good? Based off what I’ve heard, the Army needs it’s own classification. There’s no pressure whatsoever for soldiers to make up reasons for why their job needs to exist, like you might see in the private sector. Soldiers have no obligation to “confirm” their relevance to the overall structure because the very fact that they are currently there is evidence enough. Soldiers will literally sit around the arms room area, fucking off for often times hours on end with nothing to do. 

My experience? The commanders are usually far more busy. Our job as juniors will be to do something remedial like laying out a bunch of comma equipment for the commander to check. The commander’s responsibility is merely to verify it is all still there, at which point we put it all back in its place and lock it up. This process takes maybe two hours of actually doing things, but becomes the whole day because we have to wait for the commander. 

So what’s the takeaway? Bureaucracy creates waste ie soldiers waiting for hours on a signature. Soldiers have no obligation or urgency to do more than what they’re told. That’s by design, not accident. From my understanding of what a “bullshit” job is, the Army is so much worse. And all on the tax payers dime. It’s sick.

eh7yd7g,"First of all, you asked why people liked to conflate communism and totalitarianism. I answered you straight up, it’s because communism NECESSITATES totalitarianism to work. If you can’t see that, you’re just not thinking about it very hard.

Capitalism:

Person A: “Want to share all of our stuff forever?”
Person B: “Sure!” or “Nope!”

Person A: “Want to do a task for me and I’ll give you resources?”
Person B: “Sure!” or “Nope!”

Communism:

Person A: “Want to share all of our stuff forever?”
Person B: “Sure!” or “Nope!”
Authority: “You HAVE to share everything forever.”

Person A: “Want to do a task for me and I’ll give you resources?”
Person B: “Sure!” or “Nope!”
Authority: “You CAN’T do a task for material gain!”

I don’t care what you’re advocating for or against, if you don’t get it, you haven’t thought it through. You can love or hate either system, but that doesn’t change the necessity of total control in a communist system.

Moving on, capitalism is just the name we call the market in action. Capitalism is just plainly people interacting. Regulation is the popular authoritarian measures against capitalism, to fix its hypothetical failings (of which there really aren’t any). All ills could be solved with contracts. That’s the point of capitalism. However, state schools have facilitated an epidemic of learned helplessness and intellectual sloth. So people just run straight to the state to “fix” problems that they perceive and really haven’t even thought out. Commonly, regulation (anti-capitalism) exasperates the ills it means to fix.

If people allowed the market to work, rather than building a state to stifle it, then we wouldn’t have a state important enough that it mattered if and when a dickhead was running it.

Furthermore, it seems that you don’t understand cause and effect. Communism’s inherently controlling nature means that markets aren’t allowed to work. It ruins industries. That is a CAUSAL relationship. When people are not starving, then you take action and the action directly leads to a change where people are now starving, that’s a causal relationship. Capitalism doesn’t and rarely has ever had a CAUSAL relationship with starvation. People starve in capitalist places. Okay. But they didn’t starve because of capitalism. They weren’t eating fine, then direct actions of the free market lead to them no longer having food. That has never happened as far as I know. That’s the difference. Causal relationships.

Communism ruins industries through something called the economic calculation problem. It inhibits market signals from attracting talent. That’s a causal relationship. We know it’s causal, because when there is no inhibition (no economic authority) those market signals exist. Market signals are pricing of goods or labor.

For instance, people begin buying wood en masse. Without anyone coordinating it, store owners begin ordering more lumber. The lumber producers can’t keep up, so they raise wages to hire more workers. They raise the prices of their lumber to compensate. Store owners raise their prices to compensate. People keep buying the more highly priced lumber, the cycle continues until it reaches an equilibrium.

In a communist economy, there are no pricing mechanisms, so when people begin running low on lumber, a coordinated effort of accounting must be made to find when and where and how much more lumber is needed. 

Same shit with healthcare. Healthcare is expensive because doctors make lots of money because lots of people want what only doctors can provide because not everyone can do what they do. People keep buying healthcare despite its cost because they want it very badly, so doctors make even more money, so more people try to become doctors.

In an ideal collectivist economy, doctors are rewarded the same as cashiers. Therefore people don’t become doctors, because it’s lots of work, and they can get the same without that amount of work. But the same amount of people still desire healthcare, so the people that are doctors are overwhelmed, or people are forced to be doctors. Either the industry is destroyed, or total control is required.

These are very simplified (to the point of abstraction) examples, but there is so much to convey and I don’t have the motivation to keep this up. ",Anarcho_Capitalism,1,1551064268.0,comment

>[Libertarians] are claiming simultaneously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism. Anyone offering such a combination confesses his inability to understand either. Anarchism is the most irrational, anti-intellectual notion ever spun by the concrete-bound, context-dropping, whim-worshiping fringe of the collectivist movement, where it properly belongs.

> anarchists *are* collectivists. Capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law, yet libertarians combine capitalism and anarchism. That’s worse than anything the New Left has proposed. It’s a mockery of philosophy and ideology

>anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the anti-intellectual side of collectivism. I could deal with a Marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding, and with much greater respect.

>And so the Right picks up another leftist discard. That’s the libertarian movement.

edjvxv4,"That's not what I said. It's a complex issue, and there's definitely a lot of issues that you can criticize the Israelis on, like shooting border crossers, launching rockets across borders, etc.; they might have a valid self-defense claim, but it's not ideal and it's not like they've historically tried their hardest to be respectful neighbors. However, the 2-state solution sounds like a radical change in the other direction, and while the idea of secession is always exciting to a libertarian, I don't see how it'd be the best outcome. To be honest, I'm not really sure what the arguments in favor of are, either, but still. I'm just not convinced that ""apartheid"" is the bogeyman that liberals make it out to be, whether it's South Africa or Israel. Arabs have civil rights in Israel and the Palestinian region still has a lot of Arabs living within it, not just on the West Bank and in Gaza. There's always been Arabs in the Knesset, and they even awarded the Israel Prize to a [Communist Arab poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Habibi) in 1992 who, based on my understanding, wasn't just a cuck for Zionism. When you look at stuff like the recently-passed [Jewish nation-state bill](https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-text-of-jewish-nation-state-bill-set-to-become-law/), which commands things like the priotization of building new Jewish settlements throughout the land, that's certainly, well, *ballsy*, but it doesn't strike me as inherently *immoral*. It's a Jewish state, and of course they have a right to their own communities. Now, it'd probably be better if they also did more to support stable, healthy Arab communities as well, but I don't see why you'd need two states to do that. If anything, it'd probably be better to keep the Jews in charge, but just apply international pressure on them to become better stewards. I don't think that there's anything extremely un-libertarian about saying, ""Ok, this is my space, over here, and this is your space, over there""; you can still travel, trade, and visit each other, since you're neighbors.

Also, I'm not an ancap, per se. That would be hard for me to reconcile with the Trump supporter flair that I've had on /r/libertarian since 2015. >_> However, I do hang out here since my views are pretty similar to yours, and the sub's become a interesting space for general political discussion compared to the dry economic stuff that kind of just bores my low IQ brain. <_<",Anarcho_Capitalism,2,1546942397.0,comment

It doesn't have to be free. It can be, but it doesn't have to be. Reducing the cost or allowing for partial cost reduction dependent on income are options. There's seemingly a lot of viable albeit not perfect options that are better than ""hope you have money"".

That will of course lend itself to lower income, which strains other areas.

eheahem,"I didn't vote. What does that have to do with anything.

Bernie's M.O. since he became a national figure has been to talk about the wealthy, and make no distinction between - his words - [""millionaires and billionaires.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTUFG74A12M). So I don't see how applying the same categories back to him is pedantic. If he has some economic reasoning other than special pleading to exclude people who own assets of 2 million dollars or less, then he should probably mention it ever. Unfortunately his rhetorical position requires him to lump together everyone the typical walmart worker would consider rich. That's how he gets voters. So if he wants to play that game, he should expect to face the double edged sword when it comes back his way.

Similar to the fact that his party goes on and on about straight, white, old, religious, cisgender men being the problem, all of which apply to him, and now he is [trying to justify his own candidacy on the basis of merit](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/676923000/bernie-sanders-enters-2020-presidential-campaign-no-longer-an-underdog).

How are businesses supposed to operate in thousands of jurisdictions? How do you deal with, say, organised crime. Do these towns have extradition agreements with each-other? There are a bunch of problems with w system like that.             
              
All governments really are endorsed criminal syndicates. I don't think the existence of organized crime is necessarily a terrible thing or something to stop society. The whole reason an organization like that would exist is to subvert in-demand laws- most escalations in that regard are driven by profit. If drugs, prostitution and gambling aren't illegal, what will they even do? Murder?              
          
Furthermore, businesses can operate in the same manor they do now. Cities already have individual laws and contracts, that's why they employ bookkeepers and managers.                        
                    
> Also, “big bombs” aren’t the only military advancement in the last 200 years. Do you also give civilians access to tanks, or any kind of explosive weapon. You’ve also dismissed the strategic advantage of precision bombing. Large centralised armies which can actually co-ordinate an invasion will always have a huge advantage over the kind or militia you’re proposing. You’re also relying on hostile countries not to nuke you purely for strategic/economic reasons. Forgive me if that’s not exactly reassuring.             
            
In an ideal society people would be able to privately own anything they want, including weaponized vehicles. An army and a government are not the same thing, there have been many instances in history of a military being a completely separate entity from the local governments, imperial japan comes to mind. Lastly, all warfare is either economic or strategic. There's no reason to go to war without an incentive. Strategic bombing would be useless with many armed people on the ground, remember Vietnam?",Anarcho_Capitalism,1,1551219514.0,comment

ehn70zp,"I think what is going on is that the populace is scientifically illiterate. They don't have a clue as to how actual research is performed, submitted for review, and then published or rejected by the scientific community. Take the latest flat earth craze, these people are not dumb, slack-jawed yokels, many of them are smart, skilled with their hands, problem solvers. But they are raised with a ridiculous suspicion of science. What they don't understand is that science is a process, it's not a person in a white lab coat. 

The same mathematical principles that underpin economics are governing the laws of motion and thermodynamics. But if you're not educated in the higher mathematics, then it all seems like hocus pocus and hand waving when someone tries to explain it with metaphors and analogy. Try reading a chemistry, physics, or medical article on Google Scholar. Most people wouldn't be able to get past the abstract. Add in pay walls from the publishing company and the barrier to scientific education is near impossible for the average citizen. 

We need skeptics in society, but we don't need cynics. Unfortunately, a lot of people are the latter. We should be training people to be researchers, able to experiment and discern credible ideas and sources from those that aren't. We shouldn't be shoveling facts into people, we should be teaching critical thinking skills. Conspiratorial thinking that explains every bit of evidence as more proof of the conspiracy is not testable or verifiable, and is not a valid foundation for public policy.

That's not entirely accurate IMO. 

&#x200B;

Religion is something of a mix of normative ethics and an epistemological viewpoint which tends to be at odds at least in part with science. It's both a theory on the descriptive ""what is"" and ""how do we do it"" as well as it is a theory on ""what we ought to do, and why"".

  
Actual science alone will never give you both answers - it will only ever tell you ""what is"" and ""how we do it"". It does not, and will not, tell you what to do with the information.   


As far as science being wrong, it can be wrong, but it is quite clearly our best system for determining ""What is"" except for limited matters.  Science gets progressively less wrong by nature.",Anarcho_Capitalism,0,1551552166.0,comment

efp5bbn,"Well if I understand your argument correctly, you’re saying that Bitcoin does have scarcity because there is a finite and quantitative amount that could ever be created. The problem with this is two folded as I see it: 

1. We have no reason to believe that if that ceiling is met it won’t be raised to allow the market to continue expanding. Otherwise the currency will experience massive deflation since no one will bid up the price of any individual block chain when they are unsure what its price will be tomorrow, let alone next year. (Supply will stay constant yet demand will fall as it becomes less accessible, therefore bringing about deflation)

2. Air too has a finite and quantitative amount in circulation. 4,200,000,000 cubic km, to be precise. Yet this finite and easy to point to number says nothing of its _relative_ scarcity. Compared to other currencies, Bitcoin is one of the most easily accessible and create-able, as shown by the fact that it is rampant in third world countries and places like Venezuela which have access to nearly nothing except electricity- which is also not very dear in relative terms. The limitations to producing the currency are less than that of wood blocks, since more people have access to a PC than to a hand axe and lumber. The fact it is so successful in emerging markets and 3rd world countries shows to me more that it has incredible potential as a medium for exchanging information without the need of a centralized power, but less that it will ever make for a stable place holder of value. If it was innately valuable we would be seeing it more in first world countries and less in rural/ agriculture societies.

It's just that there are 1000 small companies for every big company so if just 5 in 1000 are scammers/rip offs it brings the illusion that you are more likely to get ripped off my smaller companies.  Smaller businesses are small because they aren't charging too much.

efp4kkg,"Tl;Dr: think Groupon, except anyone creates coupon redeemable for fixed value.

So I've always started with: money != Currency != Coupon. I'll define, money is a tangible asset like gold, that we BELIEVE has value; currency, up until Bitcoin, had been a celebration of Dead presidents that we BELIEVE has value. There difference between a $1 and a $100 is the arrangement of ink. Bitcoin's valuation is in USD. Everyone uses USD as the denominator, or their local currency. 1btc != 1 lambo. Coupons are a token redeemable for fixed value. Groupon is an ELI5 of coupons. Value and valuation are not the same thing. It was explained to me by a friend like this: I have to take a pill every 4 hours or I die. It costs $1.65 that's the valuation, the value is my life. USD, at least here, is accepted everywhere. Maximum convertibility. BTC has the most convertibility out of the cryptos. But I'm not buying had with it. 

So imagine having a wallet, you can trade, conduct commerce, like you have been with currency. But you have this other section in the wallet that allows you to instantiate a block chain for your crop of wheat, or barrel of whiskey, or some craft or service you provide. Only those you trade with need a copy of the block chain so it would be relatively light for most. You can use smart contracts with 3rd party assurance and logistics. The intent was fully decentralized free trade in something like IRC for channels to advertise contracts/services/products. Channels could also collaborate to instantiate a common modicum redeemable to their members. Say you needed a node.js developer, you could go to #nodejs-India and pay what would effectively be $35/hr, but their membership requirements are very loose or go to #nodejs-pros that require 5 year minimum experience backed by smart contracts as references. Where you'll pay effectively $80/hr. I know I'm using USD, but it's easier to conceptualize. Infact I was there to be coupon backed by the members that agree on price. They list contracts/services denominated in the agreed coupon for that channel. 

You can acquire the coupons by facilitating they wants. Water/food/ whatever, coupons for hookers for all I care. You acquire/provide requested coupons redeemable for what they need, and redeem the coupons for what you need. But the barter system was shit you say, I know. But man communications sure have improved. Algorithms to find least cost path to trade can be implemented. We can remove the speculators and bankers that extract and freely trade.

I have a lot more depth than that to the intended project. This is getting kinda long and I'm sure people will shit all over it. But I'm hoping the surplus labor we have in the US would be interested in brokering their services on a decentralized Network to supplement their lack of income.

efqhcqv,"> Gold and silver are fundamentally fiat currency.

Gold and silver are commodities.

The weird thing about the Goldbug Paulites is that they want to *fix the exchange rate* between USD and precious metals, rather than letting it float.

There's a whole bunch of reasons why you wouldn't want to do that, not the least of which has to do with our expansionary private credit system.  You'd very quickly run into ""metal shortage"" crisis situations where the exchange rate didn't reflect the real market price.

I tend to agree that precious metal-backed currency is preferable on the whole, but crypto-currencies solve the issue of centralization so they're worth developing further. Fiat money being backed by fuckall isn't really the problem. The problem is that those who control the fiat money can erode its value if it's not limited in some way. Precious metals are useful in this regard but crypto-currencies have the potential to be even more useful.

Money is just. Lol.   Our so called currency is just a median of exchange in where the entity providing the median takes as they please.  

Bushel of potato story is a good one. 
Before a median of exchange existed it was value for value exchange.   

I digs holes for a living. Small holes big holes for whatever projects someone might be doing.   

You grow potatoes. That's what you do.

You need holes dug so I asses the job and how many hours of labor it's going to take me.   

I happened to need potato's for the next week to help feed my family for the next week. 

So I come back to you and say ""I want a bushel of potatoes for the holes dug"". 

You asses how much time and labor you had to put into it to see if it's worth it, and it is.   So we shake hands.   I dig the holes , you give me potatoes. 


All said and done.   The debts are settled. 



Nowadays.  It's tricky.   Nowadays I dig holes still lol but I'm not call the hole digger anymore . I'm an excavator service lol.   

The same job but instead you can't give me the bushel of potatoes for my services in certain ordinances.      Our debts are settled by an exchange median.   This only makes sense if you don't have services I need .  Just like back then... There was gold or silver or whatever median that held real value.   The Federal reserve note doesn't have value.   

You give me 100 bucks for my services because I think the 100 will buy me $100 worth of potatoes but instead it's only worth $50 worth of potatoes.  Now there is taxes on top of services so my value of labor went down.      This drives prices through the roof. Now I have to charge $200 for my services and you have to charge more for potatoes.  With tax

Now even after inflation. The $1 loses just 1 cents...it's not noticed because what I get for 99 cents still seems like I'm getting $1 worth.  All those little 1 centers taken out of every dollar....lol it gets mostly pocketed

I mean, maybe, sure.  But that doesn't really solve the inflation problem.  ""Prominent"" in a market this small is a very relative term.  And new cryptos can take market share relatively quickly, depending on how aggressively they're hyped.

> That is why each addition of crypto units does not inflate the whole space.

The last couple of years have seen huge deflation within the crypto markets.  And shifts in the political and technical space routinely cause inter-currency volatility as people pile out of one crypto market and into another.

If you were in Ireland, there is no feasible way for us to exchange goods for a labor service unless you wanted a service done here in where you would send the goods after it's finished.  Or you don't have what I want but you have something I want. I would need something that's a median where you can get what you want.    That's were money plays a role but the money itself is just not worth it because someone is stealing from the value of the median. And stealing big time. That's why all these countries go bankrupt.     See, it's probably fair that the service that's providing the median for exchange takes a fee.  That's fair enough , but they are going beyond their fees and outright stealing .  If they didn't then countries wouldn't be going bankrupt or in masses amount of debt because of inflation  . dollar would still be worth 1 dollar.   This is where Fractional reserve banking plays a role.

   I can start a bank for however much it costs to start s bank. Then I can loan out 90% of the deposits to myself. Then re deposit that loan, and then loan out 90% of that.  I can do that 10 times.  Now I just created money out of thin air digitally. I just took out 90% of the value of whatever currency or divided amongst all circulating currencies for a loss of a fraction. (Inflation) 

This is why banks run the world.  They control all the debt. They have artificial buying power to do this, and they do it with our money... Scott free to do as they please.  

Look at how much money laundering scandals come out of banks like so many different banks.  The latest is Deutsche Bank .     Why are they still in business after all this dirty shit?   Any normal business would be shut down by now because their are laws that protect them.   

Now... How does the law protect you from being prosecuted from breaking laws ?    Because they made those laws or lobbied to get them made.   

I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I just see the truth.     Watch ""Hitler in color"".  Every 15 minutes that passes in the film, they show a country involved in the war going bankrupt and the banks shutting their doors when people try to withdraw their money.  

Look at Libya when Obama used military intervention.  After it was in shambles ...SUDDENLY. out of nowhere a new central bank was installed.

Why on earth not?  If the crypto is a bad investment, you'd be foolish not to GTFO.

You're assuming individuals have complete information and that financial decisions are more a question of nerve than substantive analysis.  But this assumption is internally contradictory.  If you need to have nerve to cling to a crypto, you're not fully informed and your choices aren't rational.  If you have substantial analysis on a crypto, there is no reason to flinch at dumping your stock the moment it becomes unprofitable.

Actually, they don't.  If they did, they would be paid as much as a doctor.  That's how value works.  People pay money for what they value.  Literally anyone with an IQ above 60 can sweep a floor or pick fruit.  Someone with the skills to be a doctor is significantly more rare, and thus more valuable.  It's basic supply and demand.

Also, doctors literally save lives.  People who pick fruit reach out with their hand and pull something off a branch.  Not exactly difficult.  About as difficult as making mud pies, in fact.

ei0a8tx,"So maybe the problem lies in that we don't value appropriately. We take the fact that hallways are clean, roads and buildings are constructed, fruits and vegetables are planted, grown, and harvested for granted. I understand that literally anyone can do these low IQ jobs however these are also jobs that literally no one wants but are vital for the basic functioning of society and serve many at once not just one at a time like a doctor. These are jobs no one wants but are forced to have out of necessity. Yes, doctors save lives and are valuable but its because of construction workers, cooks, janitors, fruit and vegetable harvesters etc that you are able to have clean institutions and food to eat and we take them for granted. Rarely does someone acknowledge the janitor at their school or place of work and no one really thinks about all of the people that contribute to the food that sustains them. 

We use the guise of supply and demand to take all of them and their hard work for granted. Many (possibly you) are able to choose to accept it that way and say that it's only fair. But what about the people that do these lowly jobs? Is it fair for them that their hard work is taken for granted even though they deserve acknowledgment for playing a significant role in keeping and maintaining society functioning and because they are taken for granted many of them have to struggle getting by due to a low wage? 

The thing is these are vital jobs, many people also make the argument that they have a choice and don't have to hold these lowly jobs. However the truth is that someone will always have to do them.

Several things. Mostly to do with ending lobbying. I want a system that doesnt propagate poor bloodlines staying poor and rich ones staying rich. I want standardized education that isn't complete shit, and I want it to be easier for people to start companies with profit distributions that arent highway robbery. 

In the meantime I want the government to take the massive amounts of wealth hoarded by the very very very few and redistribute it to the people who have been shafted.

Both ends of the coins. Trump is the most libertarian president since Coolidge (short bar to hop), and sometimes gets it right. 

Example, today he talked about scaling back the military. He talks about the Fed destroying the stability of the system.

e329d7r,";( feels sad...

Bad feelings apart... I am from europe and i own a small middle class business with my family, nothing big or fancy but a pretty succesful business in our market.
Last year we were doing a tradeshow/fair and we met an american colleague that did our same job in the us.

Very differents settings (we small town, he one of the biggest city in texas) but he showed us photos of his family shop: unbelivable how big the shop was and how many pieces a year he could manage to sell, and the quality of service you can see and smell even from photoes.

Another time i spoke with my country distributor for another brand he has been to the us to the presentation of a new product: he bought for our entire country less than 10 pieces of this new product hoping to sell them in a year to dealers like me (a product that retails for about 15000usd) while the two people that had in the seats near him (two dealers in two us cities) bought more than 100 each and they said that the majority were preorders so they were buiyng products they know they will sell fast).

America is still the land of opportunity... I really envy (in the positive roll back your sleeves and work more/better/smarter way) the american way and the oppurtinies americans enjoys (and worked hard for).

I'm from a first world country (heavy taxes and shit) but a relatively free and economically rich country and you americans should be proud about how much your country was built (and still is) as a bastion of freedom.",Anarcho_Capitalism,26,1532603995.0,comment

e2g7nz5,"**Nordic model**

The Nordic model (also called Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy) refers to the economic and social policies common to the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Sweden). This includes a comprehensive welfare state and collective bargaining at the national level with a high percentage of the workforce unionized, while being based on the economic foundations of free market capitalism. The Nordic model began to earn attention after World War II.Although there are significant differences among the Nordic countries, they all share some common traits. These include support for a ""universalist"" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy and promoting social mobility; a corporatist system involving a tripartite arrangement where representatives of labor and employers negotiate wages and labor market policy mediated by the government; and a commitment to widespread private ownership, free markets and free trade.Each of the Nordic countries has its own economic and social models, sometimes with large differences from its neighbours.

e2g2hv8,"As a Dane it is really horrifying seeing this amount of disinformation and discreditation all because people in America lack sound arguments against better welfare and healthcare. There are many issues with our model of socialism - which I also abhor has become a bad word in America. But the argument for a better healthcare sector, and in fact generally a better public sector, in the US can be drawn from many other places including France and Canada, pretty much any westernized country will have an in my opinion better version than the American “can’t afford to live”- model. 

Oh and just to be sure, no 40% of our GDP is not derived from a single company and the thought it self should’ve been pretty easy to dismiss if one thinks it through. Even when including false comparisons like including the money effect from the wages and what not it is still incredibly far away.

This has allowed medical schools to charge outrageous prices for medical school because they have no competition from schools that offer a lower quality education.

Now I’m not saying the answer is do reduce pay for the doctors that should be a market allocation ( albeit that’s also skewed due to the educational problems and cost in the US but let’s stay out of that topic) but the problems are exacerbated because of the various layers one has to go through ( insurances ) to get access to healthcare but also because healthcare in my opinion should not be a profit driven sector but rather a national priority like police forces, fire departments, etc. it serves to fulfill a basic citizens needs for safety and health and i believe you can discuss how much a state should interfere and that’s fine I believe there to be no right answer from almost minimal interference to state run healthcare. But I believe that no person should ever be turned away for basic health needs due to cost. Of course there’s edge cases where philosophy and more lofty ideas become the discussion point such as at what point should a state say an effort to cure someone is too costly ?

And what about those whose delegates don't get elected? The minority opinions. They are compelled to live the way the majority says. That's authoritarian. Democracy is authoritarian, as is any form of government. Ancom is not anarchy.

You're welcome to have a commune in ancap. You want shared property, go for it. Others who disagree with you are allowed to live how they want. There is no compulsion. The reverse is not true in ancom. Ancom is not anarchy.

So, what’s the point? You have not even attempted to show that the tax will have some effect at all.

eu223d7,"Articles like the one pictured above are precisely why anarcho-capitalism will never become a legitimate sociological configuration. By claiming to be ""above the fray"" when it comes to cultural, group identity, and racial issues, you concede the space and allow groups of people who are *more than happy* to step in and subsequently shit in your philosophy's mouth with absolutely no repercussions.

Promoting false narratives is the bread and butter of a complicit media -- they're ecstatic that they're able to rake in ad revenue by continuously writing clickbait articles insinuating freedom-loving Americans are vile bigots. It pays BIG to lie, deceive, and cheat. How's that for a profit motive?

As such, the first step in moving beyond the naiveté of anarcho-capitalist thought is accepting the fact that people's decisions are not primarily driven by logic, but by emotion, and emotive forces are far better at organizing masses for political power. Expecting people to accept ethical individualism, self-reliance, and to abide by the NAP like good goy automatons is, to borrow a phrase from Mises, ""the fancy of cloud-cuckoo land.""",Anarcho_Capitalism,-1,1563380630.0,comment

True, that wasn't your argument, your argument was that it can't exist because people can slander right now without repercussions.  You are placing the state overlay on an ancap society.

>The question is: can an anarcho-capitalist society even exist when the people required to uphold said society

Note how I cut you off because everything after that point is irrelevant.  No one is required to uphold an anarchist society.  That's kind of the whole point.  If someone chooses not to participate, they can do so.

>you envision government as a distinct, separate, and monolithic entity that works to the contrary of an otherwise logical, moral & ethical populace.

Uh what?  The population is anything but moral, ethical, or logical.  We make no mistake in that.  No one is saying that without government, everyone would be moral.

>Government IS the people, and any mask it wears is simply the projection of the wishes of the group that was most able to assert its power.

Yes, that's why we know that government is unethical, immoral, and illogical.  We recognize that since people as a whole are all those things, any entity they create will be the same.  Thus, we reject giving a massive amount of power to an entity that is unethical, immoral, and illogical.  Removing the power of my neighbors to enact their illogical policies on me is the best possible outcome.  If I choose to act immorally, then that action is on myself and not on the rest of society.

The state has not always existed.  This is hilarious.

>An ancap overlay is purely hypothetical and, moreover, cannot exist so its evidentiary legitimacy is null. 

I mean it has existed, so I'm not sure why its existence is ""null"".

>You may reject the concept of consolidation of power, but to have the distributed-society functioning on the basis of no force that you envision would, ironically, require the preemptory use of force.

It literally does not.  If no one has the authority to use force first, then the only force used is either unlawful, and reactionary force (which isn't a violation of the NAP) would be justified.  I'm not sure you know what the word preempt means the way you are using it.

>If you don't assert yourself, somebody else will.

You can assert yourself without force.

>You would do well to recognize your assertions as what they are -- absurd fancies that fly in the face of plenitudes of evidence.

I mean we have evidence that anarchy works so I'm not sure what you're going on about.

There are a lot of mostly young women who attract young males over Instagram, or Twitch (The Livestreaming website). What they basically do (on twitch at least) is, they chat and talk to their viewers. In order to do that, you usually have to send her money (usually small ammounts, but lots of them). Those poor guys who send those girls money probably believe that they establish some sort of connection with that woman and maybe have a chance with her. (Which ofc they dont have) The girls also know that and hide that they are in a relationship on purpose. Those women we usually call ""Twitch Thots, or E-girls"", etc. These women also sometimes (or most of the time? I dont know) have ""premium Snapchats"", so you send her a certain ammount of money (Like $25) and you get ""premium snapchat content"", probably Bikini shots of her etc.

This specific drama started because some E-Girl sold ""premium snapchat"", but didnt report her earnings to the IRS and some dude reported her for it. So now people start reporting those women to the IRS, because lots of them probably dont report all their earnings. Its basically a big ""Fuck you"" gesture.

&#x200B;

the reality is MOST PEOPLE don't vote at all. And many whores are anarchist or capitalist. Many of the first towns in the Old West were founded around brothels, and Whores were among the first female property owners in America that made it rich. Weak men hate rich women who use their sex to get rich, because they have been rejected so many times that they gain a sadistic pleasure in watching the whore suffer. It is one of the main reason's why, in Christian culture, Jesus is depicted in the Bible as protecting a whore from execution. The story is important, because it teaches the moral that Liberty should be more important than sadism.

dhy6xg3,">but because of how little I got out of it. $9.30 / hour of that insanity?

Did you require special training?    Are you an expert?

I've made a lot less than $9.30/hr doing more than that.   You are not performing labor that requires special training or skill.   If it does require special training it may take you a few minutes of getting told how to do it.

Work is tedious.    There are many forms of tedium.   That doesn't mean because you were bored and it sucked that you suddenly should be getting paid more.     People should get more based upon merit.   Odds are if you stick it out and do all of that type of stuff without complaint that you will get a raise.    Finding workers that will do the work without complaining is becoming far more difficult.   There are also a lot of people that want a job and don't have them.

From what you described that sounds boring, but I've done worse.   Many people do worse every day.   Why?   It has to be done.   Someone has to do it.   Yet if it requires no special training or skills then why should you be paid as if it does simply because it is tedious.

I'm surprised you were an Ancap before you graduated from high school really.    I doubt it fully actually makes sense to someone until they've been working a lot longer than you.

Just wait until you DO stick it out and get a raise to say $15/hr and then they come along and make the minimum wage $15/hr.    Have fun training and supervising the people that are making the same amount as you.   Let's see how motivated you are to bust your ass when people who know less than you, do less than you, and have dealt with less stress, shit and effort are being paid the same as you.   That is a product of socialism.

>""If only I were in a socialist country,"" I thought, ""the shelves would be completely empty and I could have finished this in like, an hour.""

No it wouldn't.   In a fully socialist country the people would just get money and not bother to go do the job.   Check your history it hasn't worked out that way at all.   If the government is going to pay you when you don't have a job, then what would motivate you to go do that tedious job if you are currently unsatisfied with $9.30/hr.   In a full socialist country you could just put forth minimal effort looking for a job without getting one and they will likely give you as much money, and food as if you had a job.   In fact, you might actually be BETTER OFF than if you had an entry level job.   The problem is that this is unsustainable.

Jobs can be tedious, but they still have to be done.    Learning to do them and not complain is a big part of the experience of becoming a better worker and being WORTH paying more.

You left out D:  I give no fucks about leftist excuses, endless sophistry, and semantic bullshit.

Since one can own private capital in Norway, it isn't a socialist country.  There may be strings attached, as there often are due to the left's paranoia, but those strings are pretty far removed from the day to day decisions of the property holder.  He/she can still determine who has access to their capital, and he/she can still direct what that capital goes towards producing.

At worst, Norway is a social democracy, which is still a capitalist system.  Because, presumably, Norwegians aren't complete fucking dumbasses. ",Anarcho_Capitalism,5,1495642228.0,comment

ec8f7oj,"The problem is that government programs almost never go away. Their budgets grow regardless of effectiveness. There are at least 17 government intelligence agencies alone (and probably more we don’t know about), and  there are over 430 departments, agencies, and sub-agencies in the federal government alone. The employees are government workers with benefits and pay far beyond the private sector:

“The cost of providing benefits for federal civilian workers from 2011-2015 was estimated to be 47 percent higher on average than for comparable private sector employees. CBO said the biggest factor in the difference in the cost of benefits was that much of the federal workforce still falls under systems that include a defined benefit pension, a concept that has largely disappeared in the private sector.

In 2014, the average federal employee salary was $84,153, approximately 50% more than the average private sector worker earned. This discrepancy increases to 78% when benefits are included. The average federal worker costs the government (aka taxpayers) $119,934.

All of government employee pay and benefits must be taken from taxpayers pockets by threat of force. Government employment accounts for anywhere between 12% and 25% of total employment, depending on the state. Certainly a large enough chunk to dictate election outcomes, where they essentially vote themselves more and more pay and benefits. 

Eventually the government runs out of taxpayers, and the whole system collapses. Money printing and borrowing can stave it off for a while (as it has) however we are seeing this coming in the foreseeable future. Look at the pensions in Illinois and other states (states can’t print money). Social Security runs out in 2034. Worst of all we’re $20.7 Trillion in debt. As the National Debt rises, the government will spend more on INTEREST on this debt next year than on the military!

Theoretically in a free market poor performing companies wouldn’t last when people are informed. Bottom line: are we best served by cooperation pursuing our best interests or coercion from the state? I can change the charities to which I donate if I discover something that I don’t like, however I’m forced to contribute to a wasteful, bloated government that is horribly inefficient and sometimes immoral.

Less problems in society due to high priced and completely unregulated drugs wreaking havoc on an individuals and families. You would also take all the monetary power out of dealers and drug cartels. It would lead to a major drop in drug violence and a major increase in the likelihood that struggling people would have access to proper treatment since the issue was taken out of the shadows and put into normal everyday life.

Most alt right are not supremacists. They just have a weak and shitty political system based on Hegel and genetic research.

Living in a market economy, it is inevitable that cultures will mix. 

&#x200B;

Northern Irish will mix with Irish, who will mix with Welsh, who will mix with Danes, who will mix with Francs, and they will mix with visigoths, and they will mix with Russians. The Russian urbinites will mix with the Siberian folk who will trade with Chinese and Mongolian. In China, there are dozens of cultures mixing in each Provence, each with thousands of years of history. They trade with the koreans and Thai, etc. Eventually Trains get invented and India trades with Britain, Planes and better boats are invented and the Brits trade with Jordan and Zaire and Chad. Americans buy from Taiwan, etc. You get the fucking point. 

&#x200B;

Markets favor profit maximization, which means people like me hire people who are best fit for the job, regardless of whether you don't like their culture. Private property, Transportation technology, and free markets make it inevitable that people's of different cultures will meet, trade, fuck, and move next door.

ejn4alp,"I’m double commenting mostly just to address the edit, which I appreciate you specifying.  

Under that definition of alt-right, I accept your view. Those people exist, and are an obnoxious element.  

My source of resistance to the definition is that I’m half black half Cherokee and have been called “alt-right” more times than I care to count.   
I’m all for mixing, and all for free intercultural trade, but am not an advocate of open borders(as a policy in the current welfare state environment), and have negative views on certain religions and cultures(but not races or any genetic assumptions).  

Islam is an issue for me. I’ve studied the religion due to several friends converting, and went to prayers with them a few times... and I found the religion vile at its most core, not simply at its fringes.    
“Black culture” is another issue for me. It assumes that because of my skin color I am supposed to act like a fucking uncivilized animal, talk like a moron, and listen to garbage music. To me, the whole idea of “black culture” is racist af, and I regularly get called an “Uncle Tom” for criticizing it.   
When see other cultures assimilating to “black culture” as a means of “urban expression”, I shudder.   
Music that promotes violations of the NAP should not be praised in a civil society.   
We can’t achieve libertarian goals if we are actively supporting anti-libertarian expression.  

Give them the right of expression,   
but be a responsible person and critique the bullshit they express.

Accepting all diversity as a positive is moronic.   Diversity is only good when curated by a mature market.    
Immature markets seek short term goals,   
and they must be advised to seek long term benefit.  
If libertarians aren’t going to be that voice, then the entire party will fail(devour itself), due to short term goals and lack of foresight.

If you have anarcho goals, then you either need to pray for an apocalypse, or start teaching young people about how to be personally responsible so they don’t need government anymore.

It's not stereotypical, no.  Republicans like to tell themselves that they can't win the PoC vote because PoC aren't religious, that they aren't culturally conservative, they aren't pro-military, and they aren't small business owners.

But demographically, nothing could be further from the truth.

When you crunch the numbers, you discover that PoC are far more likely to fit the GOP voter profile than their White counterparts.  And it gets even crazier when you break the numbers down by gender.  Case in point, a black man is five times as likely to be a Republican as a black woman.  That's far more favorable a split than among the white cohorts.

PoC would normally be fertile ground for GOP recruitment, if the GOP weren't constantly shooting themselves in the foot on messaging.

All that small government, low taxes, conservative culture rhetoric goes right out the window when you're screaming ""Build The Wall / Raise the Tariffs / Reject the Christian Refugees"".  What was the cornerstone of the Republican movement in the 80s - saving people from the horrors of Communism - has been completely reversed out in the 10s.

I mean, I can't speak for ""The Poles"" generally speaking.  But I've got family all over Manhattan and Queens who trace themselves back to the Polish diaspora of Jews that came over a century ago.  They're all Hillarycrats.

The closest thing I have to a conservative up there is my uncle, who came out in 2008 as a big Mike Gravel supporter.

> It always made sense to me as there is a pretty strong anticommunist sentiment with my parents generation and Poland itself glorifies Ronny reags.

NYC used to be ground zero for Rockefeller Republicanism.  They died out in the Bush Era, when Michael Bloomberg (one of the few Republicans my up-north family would consistently vote for) declared himself an Independent.

And with the country's immigration policy growing more and more frigid, there's no new influx of migrants into the NYC community to give anyone any kind of outsider perspective on anti-communism.

Fifty years ago, the city would be receiving a massive influx of Venezuelan ex-pat migration and would have a lively community of anti-Maduro small businessmen building up a rich and prosperous community of dissidents.  This community would be right next door to the anti-Ayatollah Iranians and the anti-Kim Koreans and anti-Assad Syrians and the anti-Xi Chinese and the anti-ALMO Mexicans.

Jim Crow segregation laws were in place for decades before that. These laws forbade the mixing of people under threat of death. Business owners were not allowed to mix customers by law. Yes, the Civil Rights act was another government interferance into people's freedom. Business owners want to maximize profit, and the ones that hired and served blacks would out-compete the racists businesses, so the racist businesses lobbied for segregation to subsidize their shit-business-model. 

&#x200B;

And all that is beside the point. I am uninterested in American politics. My point is that markets and private property ALLOW people the freedom to associate and disassociate. those who want to associate with other cultures can, and the ethno-boys will lose their paradise.

I found wisdom in his take on ‘personal responsibility’, ‘self-authorship’, and ‘individual narrative’ being directly correlated to ancient narratives (suggesting that social conditioning plays its part only within the bookends of a more primal-instinctual structure of ‘meaning’). I’m not quite sure what his political views are, but his social views I have a fairly firm grasp on. I assume he leans towards mixed systems with moderate-state structural elements limited by republic and constitution, but this is somewhat an assumption and perhaps a partial projection.  He seems to assume some kind of “collective unconscious” which unifies humanity, and rejects any attempts to further centralized collective action because, in his view, the apparatus of collective will is already in place, and is already moderated appropriately by survival instincts and self-authorship(free will).

You’re absolutely right about trade and cultural mixing.  
We have evidence throughout history of this pattern of wealth generation being directly linked to inter-cultural exchange of products and ideas.   
Any ideology which views mixing as a net negative outcome is blind to reality.   
Cultural preservation is an interesting topic, but that is what we have museums and toga parties for lol.

I like the way you’ve phrased the licensing issue. Private certifications are marketing based on public perception of value and trustworthiness of the institution granting the certification, and therefore very much in line with free market ideals.   

My issue with limited liability is the false risk-market that is created by impersonal entities being given personhood status and credit. It favors large businesses, and allows CEOs to make risky decisions and negligent company policies due to the lack of personal risk.   
It detaches business from personal responsibility, and feeds the “it’s just business” toxic behavior associated with capitalism.   

Eliminating limited liability would likely destroy the modern stock market... but I’m not a fan of such detached and impersonal casual investment anyways.  Crowdsourced loans seems a more natural and ethical model for casual investment.    

In the long run, I believe that removal of limited liability would decrease economic disparity, reduce market bubbles and depressions, increase competition, increase survivability of small businesses, decrease the influences of lawyers on economics, remove a large portion of government power from economics, and help capitalism adapt smoothly into he future automated economy.

Stocks are not ipso facto bad or state run. But in a republic, it is easy for rent seekers (large firms) to pay for laws that pass in their favor, to stifle competition, or to force-funnel retirement money into stocks they otherwise would not have funded. 

I think within 20 years there will be no ""NYSE"" or traditional stock exchange. all of those are HEAVILY regulated (as a poor person I can't just start shorting stocks based on my own risk assessment, you have to have several thousands in capital first before you are ALLOWED to trade in certain things. Huge Barriers to entry, when ultimately, Stocks are Crowd-Sourced funding, with a contract that allows the crowd funder to share in the profits if there are any.

Edit: To add to this, and to understand how LL is good, think about kickstarter. Should you be held criminally liable for the decisions of a kickstarter company just because you gave it money? That is what a stock basically is. Stock holders NEED to disperse the costs of failure so that the risk is lower and it is worth their money. I would never give to a company if I could be held liable for the crimes of the firm later.

 In the near future, most firms will probably be funded in a crowd-source manner, independent of any stock exchange, possible even encrypted so the state can't know who spent what. It will create a new stock market, one that has more natural reflections in how much people actually want to invest.

I don't know what a white market is. I do know that many firms hire black people, and many firms are headed by white people, so it doesn't follow. And to say 3-20% max is A LOT OF PEOPLE, ya dingus. 20% is 1 in 5. 3% is still 1 in 33. My argument is a simple economic one; the firm that hires that 3-20% based on the profit they can bring will out-compete the firm that practices ""purity in employee cultural unity."" This is why Jim Crow laws were put in place. The racist business could not compete with the non-racist business because their hiring qualifiers were not based in comparative advantage, but in non-economic factors. These firms use a lobbying tool known as ""rent seeking"" to pass laws that protect them from the scary minorities and the businesses that work with them. 

&#x200B;

\>  If it weren't true, the market interferance laws would not exist.

The hOEP Project will give the average consumer a 32.5% price discount while replacing the status quo economic and political social systems at the same time.  Google Search for ""The hOEP Project"" to discover a completely voluntary, highly profitable, non-government solution to poverty, politics, and the Collapse of Civilization.  The hOEP project is a collection of  research  and financial technology innovations produced by  behavioral economist, Extra-terrestrials, Artificial Intelligence, Techies in SF, and hackers.

Imagine if next time you went shopping, everyone richer than you paid more and everyone poorer than you paid less for the same things. Also, at the same time, the average prices for the average consumer went down 30% and sellers made 20% more profit.

There are certain situations that the system still can handle but that is in spite rather than thanks to the high taxes. For the past twenty years the healthcare system has been heavily bureaucraticised where doctors in the name of equality (class, not gender) can’t have assistants do the paper work but are forced to do it themselves. This has led to trained nurses acting as stop gates between the patients and the doctors rather than doing nursing. This in turn has led to that you as a patient need to see your appointed “primary care giver” that can give you a document (remiss) that is sent into the system and you get an appointment to see a doctor in 3-6 months. Should you need surgery it is not uncommon for people with some stamina left to get it abroad (often Norway as they bill the Swedish health service system (Landsting)), in a couple of days or weeks rather than months or even years.

Well-managed businesses run themselves.  My uncle oversees sixteen different shops up in and around Philadelphia.  If he spends more than 20 hours on the job, it's a long week.  About the only exception is quarter close, when he works an honest 40.

After that, it's just hiring people who hire people who do the work.  He'll talk your ear off about the 100 hour weeks he worked back in the early 80s, but those days are far behind him.

Doesn't hurt that real estate was dirt cheap in the 80s or that my grandfather was a millionaire who passed my uncle a healthy chunk of seed money.  But it takes money to make money, amirite?

> So your assumed dichotomy of ""the workers"" vs ""the boss"" makes no sense.

The dichotomy typically just boils down to who had that early opportunity to make lucrative investments.

We read Machiavelli, Plato, and Orwell.  We went through the Constitution, and the bill of rights. We were told that each state in the US was supposed to be an experiment in Government, and that we were supposed to vote with our feet and encourage the kind of Government we wanted.

eh3sk3q,"**Lebensraum**

The German concept of Lebensraum (German pronunciation: [ˈleːbənsˌʁaʊm] (listen), ""living space"") comprises policies and practices of settler colonialism which proliferated in Germany from the 1890s to the 1940s. First popularized around 1901, Lebensraum became a geopolitical goal of Imperial Germany in World War I (1914–1918) originally, as the core element of the Septemberprogramm of territorial expansion. The most extreme form of this ideology was supported by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and Nazi Germany until the end of World War II.Following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Lebensraum became an ideological principle of Nazism and provided justification for the German territorial expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. The Nazi Generalplan Ost policy (the Master Plan for the East) was based on its tenets.

eh5bqam,"> Muh gibs are the problem here not the immigrants. We're on the same page.

No, no, we are not on the same page. The immigrants are in their own page and they come for gibs, I don't think they are evil for doing it, but we are clearly not friends, we are enemies, because they are willingly and happily taking advantage of the natives. That's my money they are leeching, fuck them. What's worse they join hands with leftists for further ""muh gibs"", in every single country, every single time. Which again, I understand, because I'm not a commie retard and I know people work through incentives and those are the incentives they have, but because of that they are working against me and the rest of the natives.

To make matters worse, a lot of them happen to be actually evil, you only have to take a look at statistics regarding crime and so on, which isn't surprising at all because muh gibs is a very depraved incentive so it's going to bring a lot more depraved people than decent people. The decent and ambitious people came when there were no muh gibs, but instead a good amount of freedom and wilderness to tame with a chance to prosper under their own means.

It's more practical to spend money curtailing immigration and controlling it to try to get the good a than trying to sell to a modern nation ""no muh gibs anymore"". In an ideal world, I wouldn't have to tell people about personal responsibility and agency and how much welfare systems degrade a nation and plunge it towards misery, but like I said before it doesn't work like that.

Trump actually won an election on the wall issue, but on the other hand you will never win an election on the issue of removing welfare, literally impossible, you are not going to get that through vote because democracy encourages precisely that. It's literally the Democrat's party entire program: ""muh gibs"". And of course, it automatically gets millions and millions of votes, why wouldn't it.

It's not like the Republican party is any better, the ""muh gibs"" are through other means but it's there all the same.

I'm talking about elections and democracy specifically, modern democracy itself is what creates the incentives which make it impossible. You can't put off a fire with more fire, no matter what you do, there are too many incentives in the system to get votes against it. The moment you talk about reducing the state's influence that implies the livelihood of millions, from government employees to welfare recipients and you can see the news circle reaction to a government stop... you can understand what that means, those millions and their families and their influence on friends, etc., it's not like they are going to vote for losing their job.

eh4gb7v,"Here are the primary differences:

Fascism in Germany:
1- property and production remained privately owned. However the state set the prices, wages, values, approved the ownership, and could force the sale of any piece of property or industry. 

2- rights were secondary to the needs of the state. Germans were expected and later required to comply with state requirements for both public(employment and laws) and private (behavior, breeding, social policy) Lives. 

3- Expansionist: Germany as a part of the fatherland propaganda desired to be a self sufficient state and therefore needed to conquer or annex territories which contained the raw materials needed by the state. 

Communism in general or in Russia generally:
1- All property and means of production was an asset of the state who assigned responsibilities for the management and labor to individuals. The state set work requirements, quotas, and use requirements, and also set the amounts of food, shelter, benefits, etc that the laborers or managers received. 

2- Rights were collective. Meaning the survival and viability of the state was supreme. Any individual could be determined detrimental or surplus to the collective need of the state. The collective as a governmental body determined state policy through successive levels of hierarchy. 

3- Internationalist: Communism was not theoretically supposed to expand through territorial acquisitions or wars, but rather through revolution. The global communist revolution was supposed to eliminate the need for individual countries. So Russia might go communist but when Czechoslovakia(or wherever) went communist they did not become part of Russia but rather an ideological comrade of Russia striving for the same goals. Promotion of the revolution in all other countries was a necessary part of the revolution. 

Neither system recognized individual rights nor the concept of a democratic republic nor the economic system based on private ownership and agreement called capitalism. ",Anarcho_Capitalism,2,1550952225.0,comment
eh706iv,"I see it because I believe the incentives will eventually reverse. 

Right now, democracy makes it so that the incentives are all about muh gibs and trying to loot the system as much as you can. This system is unsustainable and there is an ever increasing amount of debt, fiscal pressure and regulations while public infrastructure and services decline or become more oppressive, such as law enforcement agencies arguing they sustain on Civil Asset Forfeiture, this was in an article recently in the subreddit.

Eventually this will lead to no service at all and even worse demands, Cuba style, so everyone will start to develop an inherent mistrust for the government and regularly engage in black market activities (which they do over there) and tax avoidance to prosper with better conditions. The magic and incentive of welfare will disappear, because there's nothing more to loot, now the government only takes and gives nothing back at all.

I suppose some people will still have the incentive of muh gibs, specially federal employees and the worst of the parasites, but the productive population won't. Today, even productive people insist on muh gibs of some degree.

This is a kind of change I see over a long period of time, generational changes will probably accentuate it. Gen Z is already far more against muh gibs than Millennials are, I think this is an expression of what I'm talking about. And also Millennials are constantly losing their faith in the system realizing there's no pension coming and ""public"" healthcare services are trash and getting worse, they are getting robbed for nothing.

I don't think there's any candidate that will ever lead it, the incentive doesn't add up much. Maybe a Ron Paul of sorts, but generally politicians live off the state and so they will work for more state and more assurances not less, logically speaking.

dyath6k,"Actually, the [Barbary Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_Wars) were undertaken by the United States Navy as a response to the Barbary States' unprovoked capture and attempted ransom of American merchant civilians. It was a strictly defensive action.

> Starting in the 1780s, realizing that American vessels were no longer under the protection of the British navy, the Barbary pirates had started seizing American ships in the Mediterranean. As the U.S. had disbanded its Continental Navy and had no seagoing military force, its government agreed in 1786 to pay tribute to stop the attacks.[9] On March 20, 1794, at the urging of President George Washington, the United States Congress voted to authorize the building of six heavy frigates and establish the United States Navy, in order to stop these attacks and demands for more and more money.[10] The United States had signed treaties with all of the Barbary states after its independence was recognized between 1786-1794 to pay tribute in exchange for leaving American merchantmen alone, and by 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million or a fifth of the government's annual budget then in tribute.[11] These demands for tribute had imposed a heavy financial drain and by 1799 the U.S. was in arrears of $140,000 to Algiers and some $150,000 to Tripoli.[12] Many Americans resented these payments, arguing that the money would be better spent on a navy that would protect American ships from the attacks of the Barbary pirates, and in the 1800 Presidential Election, Thomas Jefferson won in part against incumbent second President John Adams, in part by noting that the United States was ""subjected to the spoliations of foreign cruisers"" and was humiliated by paying ""an enormous tribute to the petty tyrant of Algiers""",Anarcho_Capitalism,44,1525224198.0,comment

dyc6ihf,"**Non-interventionism**

Non-interventionism or non-intervention is a foreign policy that holds that political rulers should avoid alliances with other nations but still retain diplomacy and avoid all wars unless related to direct self-defense. An original, more formal definition is that non-interventionism is a policy characterized by the absence of ""interference by a state or states in the external affairs of another state without its consent, or in its internal affairs with or without its consent"".

This is based on the grounds that a state should not interfere in the internal politics of another state as well as the principles of state sovereignty and self-determination. A similar phrase is ""strategic independence"".

The Barbary Wars were a series of conflicts that culminated in two wars fought at different times over the same reasons between the United States, Sweden, and the Barbary states (the de jure possessions of the Ottoman Empire, but de facto independent, Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli) of North Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Swedes had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800; they were eventually joined by the Americans. At issue was the Barbary pirates' demand for tribute from American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. If ships of a given country failed to pay, pirates would attack the ship and take their goods, and often enslave crew members or hold them for ransom.

I'm not well versed enough in the leadup to American involvement in WWI to comment, but as far as WWII goes, there was nothing remotely isolationist about it.

We sent arms and ammunition to Britain and the USSR in armed naval convoys that could and did exchange fire with German warships **a full year before we entered the war.** We embargoed the Japanese and confiscated all their assets in America **six months before Pearl Harbor.**

While the US did play a crucial role in late stage WWI, it was the Bolshevik revolution & British military chutzpah which won it.

As for WWII, the Soviets indisputably won that war--the number of Germans they killed & territory they reclaimed vastly outmatches the rest in the European front. Following, somewhat farther behind, is the UK. Then the French & the US, but much lower.

In the Eastern Front, it's a bit different. China was the key Japanese land battle & the British were instrumental in Southeast Asia. The US primarily fought Pacific island battles.

The Soviets finally violated their non-ag pact & declared war on the Japanese. The Japanese then initiated processes of conditional surrender internally, sending out feelers, when the US bombed Hiroshima & then Nagasaki.

dyarnio,"Too lazy to respond to most of your post, but the fact that you refer to the Pacific Theatre as ""the Eastern Front"" should make any observer immediately question your conclusions. In common parlance the Eastern Front almost always refers to the combat between Nazi Germany and the USSR in Eastern Europe and Russia. 

You're wrong about WWI. Without US troops there almost certainly would have been a negotiated peace. The Germans conducted an offensive in March 1918 which ultimately failed strategically but did serious damage to the Entente. I highly doubt the French and British could have defeated the Germans without American manpower. I'm not clear on what you mean by the Bolshevik Revolution winning the war, unless you mean that the enormous amount of territory the Germans had to occupy actually sapped their manpower, which is true

Agreed with regard to the Russians in WW2. However it sounds absurd to say the British killed more Germans than the Americans, that sounds hard to quantify to me and I'm not really sure there is any actual basis on which to state that. 

""The US played a key qualitative role, but they were by no means the major one, and especially not quantitatively speaking."" This statement is wrong with regard to the Pacific Theatre. And to be honest it doesn't really refute what you were responding to, neither Germany in WWI nor Japan in WWII would have been defeated without the US, raw casualty numbers or not. So in that case, yes, you can say the US intervention ""won WWI"" and ""won WWII in the Pacific.""

In most cases, no. However, an all out war with a huge superpower may be even more costly, in terms of both lives lost and money spent. 

I know there's loads of dispute over us entering WWII, but I'm curious when the right point to fight Hitler would have been if he and his allies left us alone. After he conquered all of Europe?

eihlgc0,"Really this is what makes anarchocapitalism objectively the better solution.

In anarchocapitalist society you can get down and suck Marxist cock if you want to and that's 100% acceptable.  Communes work and might even work well.  

The point is that the overarching nothing doesn't care. It's ultimately voluntary.  If you want to start your own voluntary super communist commune with land that's owned by the Mao-Marxist-Kim Policial Commune of Juche Ultra-Limited Liability Corp, that's fine.

Now, try that in reverse.  An anarchocapitalist or any other community can't obviously can't (legally) exist within socialist or communist states.  What's hilarious is in practice a lot of times that's what happens, since they fail in practice,... But bottom line is the reddest of the red community along with any other sort of community can exist within an anarchocapitalist one and the opposite just does not exist.

eiicms4,"Democratic Socialism : political philosophy that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production

Social Democrats : is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist economy. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to representative and participatory democracy, measures for income redistribution and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions.

Source: Wikipedia

Both are the same thing at the end of the day. DS is about democracy alongside with social ownership. SD is about wealth redistribution inside a capitalist society and the end goal of SD is to create the conditions for a capitalist system to lead to a more socialist system.

ecd9bx8,"**Washington Monument Syndrome**

The Washington Monument syndrome, also known as the Mount Rushmore Syndrome, or the firemen first principle, is a term used to describe the phenomenon of government agencies in the United States cutting the most visible or appreciated service provided by the government when faced with budget cuts. It has been used in reference to cuts in popular services such as national parks and libraries or to valued public employees such as teachers and firefighters. This is done to put pressure on the public and lawmakers to rescind budget cuts. The term can also refer to claims by lawmakers that a proposed budget cut would hinder ""essential"" government services (firefighters, police, education, etc.).

The issue isn’t that nice private infrastructure does not exist, it’s that nobody would pay for public infrastructure if the government did not exist. The private sector would would not take the role to replace public infrastructure and maintain it because they’d have absolutely no feasible way to get the money from “customers”. Again, this is the free rider problem.

eclna58,"> a public good that is paid for by and large by taxes, with extra coming from those who use the service more often than those who don’t.

Replace taxes with a consortium of private interests, and we're good to go. Free rider problem solved.

I personally don't take a hard ideological stance, and I have not yet found a satisfactory answer about how to take care of the public good using pure incentive structures. It seems to me that some form of conscious choice to do right is required -- that not everything is a pure market transaction. That leaves the question of whether or not the state is any good for generating conscious awareness. So far, in my experience as a precocious kid in the public school system -- it is NOT.

I perceive the government as a the same as a shitty corporation that steals from you by threat of violence and writes its own laws. It seems to me that a private org could get and job done for less.

> Most things that require public funding would not get done without- wait for it- public funding.

Nice circular reasoning there, haha. This is the kind thing that drives an-caps and the like crazy. The rule of the state is so deeply ingrained within our lives, it becomes very difficult to extract it from your models. ""things that require public funding"" are a consequence of the state, not the originator of it.

> Post offices are usually well-maintained.

Ok bud, enjoy the post office, because the larger the state becomes, the more it's going to look like a post office or a DMV. Personally, I think that's a terrible future.

eclpoma,"You’re not making sense from an economic standpoint. You’re just replacing a simple system of taxation and spending with a multi-tier system that opens up numerous avenues of exploitation. 

Let’s go back to roads for a second. Replacing taxes with a “consortium of private interests” still leaves multiple questions open like... where do they get the money and resources to build and maintain these roads? Why would they, out of the kindness of their hearts, build and maintain roads for everyday citizens? How do they set up a transaction between the consumers and themselves so they are reimbursed? What is stopping competitors from opening up roads to compete with them, granted that this is lucrative enough to get anyone money in the first place? 

Furthermore, roads are currently not built and maintained to make a profit. Putting this in the hands of private citizens will change that, making roads more expensive. And the fact that roads are an important part of our society, the corporations are going to be price setters when they collect money for the roads, if they can even make it that far. 

Why replace our current, simple system with this clusterfuck of problems.

> You’re just replacing a simple system of taxation and spending with a multi-tier system that opens up numerous avenues of exploitation.

An-caps believe that a free market is a simpler solution than a bureaucratic state. The multi-tier system with avenues of exploitation is a feature, not a bug. That's how the market optimizes itself.


> where do they get the money and resources to build and maintain these roads?

As a for-profit business they use their earnings to invest in the infrastructure that enables their business. This is like asking ""where does Safeway get the money and resources to build and maintain the front entrance to their building?""


> Why would they, out of the kindness of their hearts, build and maintain roads for everyday citizens?

No kindness of heart required -- only rational self-interest. Everyday citizens are customers, and there's an incentive to keep customers happy and enabled.


> How do they set up a transaction between the consumers and themselves so they are reimbursed?

Well for the example of roads, they might not need to as long as the road terminates at their front door. For the FedEx example, the infrastructure cost (jets & feul, for example) is included in the cost of shipping a package. In the case that there is no other way, I'm sure private industry could create a technical solution better than stopping your vehicle and handing over dollars -- RFID for example.


> What is stopping competitors from opening up roads to compete with them, granted that this is lucrative enough to get anyone money in the first place?

Of all your questions, this one really reveals your mindset. Nothing is stopping them and that's why it's so great! That's the entire point. Roads are now open to competition instead of a state monopoly. This is a GOOD THING that will produce BETTER ROADS. Shit -- the competition may even manifest something that is BETTER THAN ROADS -- like underground magnev and such.


> Furthermore, roads are currently not built and maintained to make a profit. Putting this in the hands of private citizens will change that, making roads more expensive. And the fact that roads are an important part of our society, the corporations are going to be price setters when they collect money for the roads, if they can even make it that far.

It's at this point that I suspect you may be trolling me. You keep boasting about economic knowledge, but then you make the claim that competition will make things more expensive? So wrong. I'm only schooled in basic economics (public school, remember?), but I'm pretty sure that's one of the first things you learn about.


> Why replace our current, simple system with this clusterfuck of problems.

Haha, it's central planning and public organizations that produce the clusterfuck. Are you just going to ignore my DMV example? They literally are incentivized to make their organization as complex as and inefficient as possible in order to secure more funding for the next year.


> You essentially stated that things that are funded by the state are products of the state’s will. Lol wut.

No -- exactly the opposite. Please read again. I said that public infrastructure exists independent of the state funding model. Bridges have existed for thousands of years, and through every kind of social/economic model ever conceived of.


> So our military is only necessary because our government told us it is?

Again, no. However, the type of military that is produced by our current model has a nasty habit of interventionism and aggressive growth.


> A safety net that aids those who lose their jobs so entire families don’t end up on the streets during trying times is only necessary because the state said so?

You seem to think that the state is the only way to produce a safety net, when in fact humans have independently found a reason to take care of each other. For example, in my city most of the homeless outreach is performed by volunteers and church organizations.


> Or are you alluding to the idea that the government creates problems that makes it so we need the things we find?

Well one thing is for sure, government rarely solves new problems. It's more likely to maintain the status quo. For example: in the world of the IRS sending you all correspondence through the USPS, can you imagine them every creating email? No way. Even now, the IRS website is among the worst on the net.

ekdhcz2,"Actually at time of the transatlantic slave trade and the genocide of native Americans (which in and on itself is an erroneous term since it implies that the westerners were the ones doing the killing, which they often did, but it was actually disease that killed most, and of the killings that were done by Europeans most were during wars, which were often unjust I'll admit that) modern capitalism didn't exist yet, most colonizing nations were mercantilists, which some consider an early form of capitalism but really isn't since the state played a huge role in the market. 

Which brings me to my next point: all of the attocities you described were carried out by governments of countries to increase their power. The British, Spanish and Portuguese governments actively made the decisions to kill start importing slaves from Africa, to prohibit aid to the Irish and to conquer the native American empires. These things weren't a product of capitalism but of governmental greed for power. And this greed isn't exclusive to nations which happened to have a capitalist economy, the USSR and PRC have also actively conquered, expanded and seized resources and factories, the USSR used it sattelites for resources and moved their industry to Russia proper, the USSR tried to conquer Afghanistan and the PRC (when it hadn't yet adopted state capitalism) conquered Tibet.

Furthermore the Bengal famine wasn't necesairily the fault of the British, there were a lot of contributing factors, like, I don't know, **WW2**. Also there's still and ongoing discussion among historians about whether anything could have been done to prevent it and if so without losing the war in India. Which could have made the situatuon a lot worse, because then the Bengali would have had to live under Japanese occupation, which I think you and East-Asia would agree, wasn't fun. 

Still even if the worst of the worst is the case for the Churchill government, then the Bengal famine still wouldn't have been a product of capitalism, it would have been the British government's fault.

I think your idea that capitalism somehow is responsible for those tragedies comes from a wrongfull equation of capitalism to communism/socialism in the sense that they are both meant systems which affect the entirety of society, which is wrong. Capitalism is an economic idea, which doesn't really include any principles on which to rule arrange a society, just as little governmental intervention in the market as possible. Socialism/communism on the other hand do call for an entire rearrangement of society, with specific plans for almost everything. This is also why deaths under communism can much easier be attributed to the ideology itself, since all actions by the state were 'communist' in the sense that the state is the embodiment of the ideology, or at least it claims to be. With capitalism this isn't the case.",Anarcho_Capitalism,6,1554709899.0,comment
ekcyrmm,"Definition of Capitalism:

>an economic and political system in which a  country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.

The slave trade occurred as a result of not viewing slaves as humans who owned themselves. Nothing to do with private ownership/capitalism. Really, the most basic form of ownership is ownership of ones' self. As for indigenous genocide, how does private ownership result in genocide? What does this have to do with capitalism? The potato famine occurred due to potato blight. How is private ownership the cause of that? Same with drought for the indian famine. On the other hand, famines under communism are due to mismanagement and poor allocation of resources directly due to communist policies.

ekcjkvt,"**Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas**

The population figure of indigenous peoples of the Americas before the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus has proven difficult to establish. Scholars rely on archaeological data and written records from European settlers. Most scholars writing at the end of the 19th century estimated that the pre-Columbian population was as low as 10 million; by the end of the 20th century most scholars gravitated to a middle estimate of around 50 million, with some historians arguing for an estimate of 100 million or more. Contact with the Europeans led to the European colonization of the Americas, in which millions of immigrants from Europe eventually settled in the Americas.

..... no.... no it's not.  That's a clear violation of property rights and is in no way related to retaining the means of ownership or free market exchanges.  It's far closer to socialism (the government violating property rights and giving the property to their favored groups) than it is to capitalism.

It’s the same reason why food and water are not rights. Without them people will die, but no one is entitled for another person to hunt or collect to sustain them. 


People who want free market healthcare aren’t advocating that people be left dead in the streets. Only to take in consideration that health care, like any other good or service, is subject to the forces of supply and demand. Private charities or just other people in the community can help a poor person pay for their care. Why should the state charge you for something that you did not consent to?

It can take hundreds of thousands of dollars to save one life. The companies and hospitals profit maximally from essential care. 

Markets themselves can't better healthcare. The profit motive and the will to save lives are at odds to each other. If a company if not profiting it will go bankrupt. That's why insurance companies are so stringent on what you allowed to do(what they can afford) instead of what is necessary for care. Why not leave that burden of cost to the government? They don't need to profit maximally off of healthcare(they have other revenue streams) and can offer insurance and the can bargain to lower prices.

>Hire mercenaries? Bad news: McDonalds will pay those same guys twice the amount if they give your property to them.

McDonald's *exists* because of the franchise system, reputation matters.

>They wouldn't get away with it? Ah, in that case they don't take it for themselves, they take it for some de facto subsidiary that de jure has nothing to do with them.

Journalists exist, and would be able to identify this. Also, a community has a *great* interest in finding and executing mercenaries who are just taking property willy nilly - they're using violence, so that's self-defense AND a strong deterrent to being a mercenary who redistributes property against the owner's will.

>You've got no way to make this work. It can only end in a mess.

Nah, civil society will follow rules. We already do this. It's the society that suggests we shouldn't have rules, that everything should be decided by some democratic committee, and that everyone is entitled to a *shitload* of free stuff, that literally has no way of possibly working.

>Under socialism I'd give people complete assurance of their personal property, in a way even capitalism doesn't. Have you ever noticed that the majority of people don't own any property? They don't even own their own house.

Sorry, you can't possibly make that offer - you *already* disrespected private property based on completely arbitrary conditions of how much someone ""deserves"". Your word doesn't mean much, and all you're saying is that you're super extra serious that you won't extend that arbitraryness to people's houses and toothbrushes.

>Further, contrary to all libertarian gesturing that people should own the fruits of their labor (we all know that it really belongs to their boss)

It doesn't, you guys say this, but profit across the board is between 5.5% and 7.5% - meaning that for every $1.00 of wealth you produce, you keep $0.92-$0.94 of it. Taxes are a much, much, *much* higher theft of my wealth - and then, consider that the socialist worker enjoys a lower standard of living than the capitalist worker, despite ""keeping all of the fruits of his labor"", whereas the capitalist parts with some parts profit, but gets... iPads and nice cars and reliable groceries and clean water, etc.

>I'd make it a fundamental right for workers in a cooperative to collectively direct where their labor goes.

e3tpsdk,"**First: A contract is an agreement between 2 or more parties.**

So in order for the ""social contract"" to be a real thing it would have to fulfill that requirement.

1) Do all individuals living within a specific geographical area explicitly agree to the terms of the agreement (""social contract"")? The answer is no.

2) I'm assuming then that your argument is that every individual living in a specific geographical area agree implicitly to the social contract by merely being born in that specific geographical area. This is absolutely fucking ridiculous. A 15 year old did not agree to be born and he does not agree to be arrested for smoking a joint by merely existing.

So, I just demolished the premise that people agree to the agreement and therefor proved that the ""social contract"" is not in fact a contract, but I'm sure my argument did not convince you and therefor I will continue to the second condition of a contract:

**After an agreement is made, individual parties do not get to change the terms of the agreement without approval of all parties involved.**

The ""social contract"" is not in fact a contract, because 1 party gets to dictate all the terms and change them on a whim. It's surreal that anyone can accept this as legitimate. Why would individual parties be allowed to change all terms and conditions at any time without consulting or even informing the other parties involved.

Are you claiming that you actually agree to all the conditions of the ""social contract"", including all changes that were performed by the government last month? Do you even know in what manner the ""social contract"" was changed last month?

Now, I probably still haven't convinced you that the ""social contract"" is nonsense, because you probably believe something like this:

**Everyone implicitly agrees that only one party is allowed to dictate all the terms and change them whenever they feel like by being born in a specific geographical area.**

This is circular logic, I already demonstrated that it's not possible to agree to all the terms of this so-called contract.

So it seems like the rules and conditions of what makes a contract don't fucking matter at all and one party can just do whatever the fuck it wants and we all some how agreed to allow 1 party to do whatever the fuck it wants by simply being born.

In summary: The social contract is an agreement arrangement that agents of the state have determined, applies to all living persons in a specific geographical area. The actors that have determined that the social contract applies to all people, have also determined that they are allowed to change the terms of the arrangement whenever they feel like. And as cherry on top of the cake, the people who make and change the terms of arrangement whenever they want get to determine to consequences of failures to abide by the terms of the contract.

The flat tax seems like it makes sense but here's why it's a horrible idea. in effect it's a regressive tax and what that means is if we were to implement it tomorrow poor people and middle class people would get a tax hike and it would be a massive tax cut for the rich. think about it lets use 12% if you take 12% of the money from someone who makes $30,000 that fucking hurts they may not be able to pay for housing or food or light bill its hard to raise a family on that. but taking 12% of someone who makes 8 million dollars a year is nothing they won't even realize it's gone they won't feel it they can have the same lifestyle. so this only negatively affects the poor and middle class and positively effects the rich. you already know its a bad idea like everyone would have to make the same amount of money for it to work its disproportionate because we dont make the same amount ",Anarcho_Capitalism,-2,1533723700.0,comment
e4fvbtu,">become a useless dependent on the government (after all, I have a right to free everything)

Quite the opposite. You'd finally have to work to sustain yourself, instead of extracting profits off the things the state decided you ""own."" There would no longer be the option to gain an advantage over others through such ossified social relations. No, finally you'd have to make your living by continually exerting your labor to the benefit of your peers.

>until I can escape to a society that culturally values property rights.

There is no such thing. Property rights are unnatural. An anarchic society would respect and contradict people's claims to property as the individuals who constitute it please. This means that everyone would likely get a house, with personal belongings roughly equivalent to those of anyone else, ensured to them by a pact of reciprocal protection between peers. But something as valuable and socially engaged as an enterprise would never be allowed to be your property. It is entirely contrary to nature.

>Journalists exist, and would be able to identify this. 

Journalists can easily be bought. Publications do not like to anger advertisers. Rebellious ones are made irrelevant. How about you fight genuine reports of corruption by flooding society with false information? Should be very easy if you have the means. Something I've always found telling is how much more corrupt and propagandizing the American ""free market"" media system is compared to European state-owned outlets.

>It's the society that suggests we shouldn't have rules, that everything should be decided by some democratic committee, and that everyone is entitled to a shitload of free stuff, that literally has no way of possibly working.

Again, you are railing against an imaginary opponent. I do not believe in a society without rules. In fact, democracy is entirely dependent on people following rules. Your strawman is blatantly self-contradictory in that way.

In my preferred society there would be clear guidelines in the rights workers have to their workplace and the goods they produce, the rights they have to gain a new workplace when the old one is lost or becomes irrelevant. Capitalist society is entirely lawless when it comes to these concrete and vital aspects of people's life. Same for people's personal homes. Tenants may be put out of their living compartment without much justification, if any. That is the way capitalism works, it has to work that way because of the structural dynamics of the free market. There are no real rules here to speak of, only the arbitrary rule of property, and the ruthless and ineffective discipline of the market.

>Your word doesn't mean much, and all you're saying is that you're super extra serious that you won't extend that arbitraryness to people's houses and toothbrushes.

All I'm saying is that we'd put it into law. A law we'd determine along with our peers, and which we'd ensure all our neighbors kept to. Is this not plenty to assure you? What assurance do you have that you'll be serious about the so-called ""non aggression principle."" Even less, that principle is entirely unnatural. People have a natural sense of justice that leads them to respect the sanctity of each others living compartments. This sense does not extend to the workplace apparently owned by a boss, a truth that many a frustrated worker will attest to. Further, your implementation of a free market will lead powerful corporations to bend and break your law however they wish, something entirely impossible in my egalitarian society based on participatory planning.

>It doesn't, you guys say this, but profit across the board is between 5.5% and 7.5% - meaning that for every $1.00 of wealth you produce, you keep $0.92-$0.94 of it.

That's after capitalists hand out the share going to their corporate elites, which often are they themselves, along with a series of henchmen keeping the authoritarian hierarchy going, and ensuring the proliferation of their market share. Thus it must be seen as a completely inappropriate statistic. 

>Aaaaaaand productivity plunges to the ocean floor.

Completely false. The reality is that worker cooperatives, on average, are more productive than authoritarian enterprises. This makes sense, since they correspond much more closely to natural human cooperation, and do not require the usual authoritarian bureaucracy keeping everything in check.

>Would people be entitled to free education, electricity, food, healthcare, heating, housing, internet, and transportation?

Some of that, if we have it to spare. We shouldn't just let useless idiots starve to death if this can be avoided. But to get the full package they'd have to provide socially useful labor. Then they'd be able to live a life as comfortable as anyone else's.

Are you ignoring the reality of the capitalist system because it makes you feel uncomfortable? That's what I imagine this works like, it is entirely understandable. People like to think that what they're doing is right. You want to assure yourself that the misery you expose yourself to every day is natural and not a misguided phase of history. It makes you feel like things are meaningful. I would say I *regret* to inform you that humanity can do much better, but I don't have many regrets about it, since I consider it purely a good thing. You simply have to get over your personal bias and learn to imagine new possibilities. In a way, I'd liken a socialist to a entrepreneur, since both engage in the exercise of imagining different ways of organizing human activity, and exert themselves in realizing these ideas. Only difference, a socialist is more in contact with his human essence as ""political animal,"" to use Aristotle's phrase. We are the only animal capable of imagining itself in a wider social context, and of reasoning on how to reform and improve this context. While the entrepreneur only things about his own profit (i.e. is caught in ""commodity fetishism,"" going back to Marx), the socialist envisions the material reality of the wider economy qua system, not just his own position within it.

Also yes we can, lacking access to healthcare is a threat to you and everyone around you whether you believe it or not. Same reason vaccines should be mandatory - all the science shows herd immunity is so much more important (and affects far more people) than a few people’s “freedom of choice”. That “freedom” consistently, provably puts us in danger. Some people can’t take vaccines because of allergies or other conditions - those people are very much threatened by people who refuse to vaccinate. Why is their “freedom” to live in a society that is healthy somehow lesser than your “freedom” to make bad decisions?

Same here, why is your “freedom” to claim you’ll never need healthcare more important than everyone else’s need for accessible healthcare? Your “freedom” “benefits” a small group by an insignificant amount of money. The other path benefits the entirety of society, including you, for an insignificant amount of money from all of us.

Also raising taxes to pay for healthcare has been shown to lower total healthcare costs so if you’re _legitimately_ concerned about the money then after a few years of universal healthcare your actual take home pay would be higher than if you opted out. It’s really a nonsensical argument that’s rooted in a flawed concept of “freedom.” You live in a society with other people and benefit from it every day, you’re not an individual in a vacuum who has no effect on the people around you. Schools, roads, power, water, etc. even if you live out in the wilderness you have benefitted from it your entire life up to this point. Why do you get to opt out of that for no real gain?

e46mc2i,"I made another comment below, I’ll rephrase and extend it here:

The money you “save” on taxes by not paying for universal healthcare is going to be a lower amount than the money you spend on healthcare services in the vast majority of cases. “Saving” money in this way actually costs you more in the long run. So if it’s a money issue then the universal healthcare route will actually put more money in your pocket.

If it’s not a money issue, then it’s an individualism/collectivism argument and to be frank and I’m at a loss as to how to get across to you and others the benefits that you have enjoyed from living in a society and why they matter - schools and education, roads, bridges, power systems, clean and fresh water systems, plumbing and sewage, etc etc.

Literally all of the things that enable you to live an “individualistic” lifestyle are benefits from living in a collective society.

Have you ever had someone in your life develop a major condition and die simply because they couldn’t afford the healthcare (which is exorbitantly priced _because of_ the existence of individual insurance, it’s literally a middleman racket designed solely to inflate prices and make money off the now proportionally higher interest gains)? That would really put things in perspective for you. When your husband/wife/parent/child/best friend dies because they couldn’t come up with tens of thousands of dollars for a treatment or medicine, maybe the idea that we all pay a few tens to hundreds of dollars more a year and everyone gets quality healthcare without the threat of dying due to circumstances outside of their control will become more attractive you.",Anarcho_Capitalism,0,1534267232.0,comment

Capitalism is cooperation because people generally are kind and work with you to get you what is need, you only compete against your direct competitors which should cause you both to make better products. Corporations are hard to face as you can't really speak the owner, and it not a natural human relationship.

du2fpq1,"> That's because ""work hard and get success"" was never the case, even when the boomers were growing up. At best, you could ""work hard and live comfortably"" and that is still true today.

Yeah, that's not true.

I lived through a time when any schmuck could graduate high school, get an industry job and support his family on one income.  'And' get 2 weeks vacation.  'And' work overtime to pay for the kids' college.  I lived through that.  That happened.

Today, you work hard and you can pay your bills if both parents work.  But, there's no 'comfortable.'  There's exhaustion and despair and no money for vacation, much less college for the kids, so they load up on student loans for an education that doesn't guarantee a good job.

This is now how it should be.  I remember a better time when working hard got you a comfortable life, IF you worked hard.

I can understand why that has an allure for many people on Reddit. The idea that anyone thinks it's okay to have a society that doesn't guarantee safety for the weak seems almost hedonistic at first glance. 

""Why would anyone not support helping the weak and the poor? Sociopath much?"" 

The way I see it is like this: I think the medicine we use right now is too expensive.

 I think our school systems are racist, offer low quality education and disable people from seeking out the best education for their proposed career goals/learning style. 

I think the way a heavily regulated economic environment crafts a society's skill sets is more standardized like a product produced in China and sold in Walmart might be. This kills creativity, limits society's productivity and by-and-large hurts our growth and ability to solve problems prevalent to our planet and species.

The cost of living as a percentage of the average gross income of individuals within the United States has increased extremely quickly in the last decade if you consider the GDP deflator instead of CPI which was thrown off by oil prices. 

These aren't problems that can be solved by making things more dominated by government, increasing taxes or putting in place more barriers to trade. This can only be solved through the only process ever used that lowers prices (most businesses avoid lowering prices unless pushed to do by threat of dying), through more competition. 

Our hospitals and pharmaceutical companies nearly hold monopolies over society's medical industry. They drive up their prices, charge patients ridiculous amounts of money for the same services you can get overseas at a fraction of the cost. Pharmaceutical companies charge as much as they want and we have to pay it. If they didn't allow IP protections over their drugs, these companies wouldn't be able to charge nearly as much. 

Our schools are funded through property taxes and only allow students from their zip code to go. Richer students live in areas that have better funding for their schools. Bellevue School district in Washington state is just one example (average home is over 1mm list price, heavily overfunded, beautiful school renovations, computers for every kid, overpaid teachers, etc). 

Conversely, bad parts of Seattle/Eastern Washington/etc all have heavily underfunded schools with large classrooms. Consequently, poor students get less opportunity and worse education. Solvable? Yep. Allow charter schools, eliminate ""districts"" or even better, privatize it entirely. 

Lastly? Freedom allows for society to solve its own problems as it always has. Pollution/global warming has been solved moreso by private companies than government regulations and would be solved even earlier if regulations on home building materials were lifted and instead hemp could have been used 50+ years ago. Cheaper, grows quicker, fireproof, better heat retention, etc. 

Tldr: the government has only hurt society's progress, put in place barriers that disable social mobility and protected oligarchs with regulations and licensing which make it harder for lower cost competitors to take their business. ",Anarcho_Capitalism,2,1518370941.0,comment

In a truly free market, the only way to get rich is to provide people with things they value more than the money they pay you. This makes them richer. They now own more value in their own estimation than they did before. 

For the most part, in mostly free societies, that's still the only way to get rich. 

Of course, as an exception, politicians are usually rich, and this wealth is gained at the expense of other people. People have no option not to pay their salaries, and so the things or services politicians provide may not be more highly valued than the money used to pay for them. They may also enact policies that restrict the ability of anyone to compete against established firms, and the owners of those firms also benefit only at the expense of other people, not mutually.

If you want to perpetuate its existence you wouldn't allow capitalism, and instead force them to be subsistence farmers. They're not working in factories because they have tons of options. The societies in which they live are very poor, which means they don't have lots of capital, so their labor is not productive enough to allow kids to go to school or play video games. While it might offend your sensitive Western sensibilities, banning child labor doesn't magically create enough wealth for the kids to go to school. Instead they have to turn to prostitution or criminal activities to feed themselves. While child labor is not preferable to not having to send your kids to a factory, it's most definitely preferable than the alternatives available to them right now. If it weren't, they wouldn't have kids working in factories. As they save up money from wages, they begin to be able to make investments of their own.

Brilliant! You can make money when there's no government backing the currency. Good for you.

On the other hand, I do believe fascists should be tortured to death. Fascists literally are subhuman. That's why they must cling to ideologies that pin them as superior. Nothing could make you so subhuman as being stupid enough to believe that the government should run everything, or stupid enough to believe that capitalism can exist without a government.

Not only is that an unconvincing argument, but it's ridiculous. There are some people born into less opportunity than others which has a direct correlation with your success early into your career. 

Does this mean I should give away all my stuff and subsequently prove capitalism to be flawed? Not at all. It's a great argument for people to ""check their privilege"" i.e. Not act like they're better than other people.

What I'm proposing isn't that rich are better, but that capitalism is the only way to guarantee societal growth, keeping society fed and continue financing our entrepreneurs innovative capacity, which is the only way our society actually improves its productive capacity.

Why is this important? Population is growing. If you don't want rampant starvation (like is seen in far left countries far more often than more capitalist ones), you must continue to grow the productive capacity of society.

e75cra5,"For this particular picture...

This was the biggest supermarket for a couple of municipalities (our equivalent to USA's ""county"" or small towns) in a few kilometers, all others were small providers, you could find here pretty much everything without having to travel into the city. They closed up for 1 year and reinforced the places with metal railings, steel doors, reinforced glass and armed security before opening again. In the meanwhile you had to travel a couple of kilometers to find another or do multiple trips to different small shops. The place was a giant ruin for 4 months and we expected it to never reopen.

This happened about 3 years ago, the communities from the lowest socio-economical counties ransacked the place in the evening, the pictures back then showed people carrying anything from your normal groceries to TVs, Radios and other stuff. Placing them in pick up trucks, like this was planned. Note that in these years there were economic problems but they were a joke compared to today's, food scarcity was not as bad -- mostly the supply of some products on high demand like cooking oil and flour but you could hardly say there were many starving.

It was disgusting, people went insane and this felt more like a result of societal decay than anything. They managed to rip off an ATM from a bank that operates in the place and they found it days later on the mountainside. 

Some believe to this day the sack was organized/initiated by government followers as they often hate big market chains for not obeying government ""regulated prices"" which are *impossible* to follow due to inflation. (Imagine a kilo of ground beef is ""government priced"" at the equivalent to 3$ but the minimal profit starts at 7$)

Currently, this super market is open and doing well. All merchandise is very expensive (relative to Venezuelan minimum wage) everywhere. You essentially need outside currency to survive here because our own currency lost 99.97% of the original value. ",Anarcho_Capitalism,22,1538656930.0,comment

Making the distinction between welfare capitalism/social democracy and socialism is NOT splitting hairs by any means. Socialism by definition is the workers directly owning the means of production. For example, under socialism a factory would be democratically owned and managed by the workers. If that's not how things are in a country it by definition is not a socialist country. People calling it socialism doesn't make it socialism any more than calling North Korea a democratic republic makes it one.

Even in Marxist literature the state owning the means of production isn't considered socialism, but state capitalism, what Marxists typically consider ""late stage capitalism,"" or the final phase of capitalism before the transition to socialism. This can be subject to criticism but actual socialist literature (as opposed to random people talking out of their asses on Reddit and Twitter) makes the distinction between state capitalism and socialism abundantly clear, so referring to state capitalism and examples like the USSR and Venezuela as socialism in and of itself is inarguably a strawman.",Anarcho_Capitalism,8,1538592235.0,comment

e73sbu6,"**Social democracy**

Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and capitalist economy. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to representative and participatory democracy; measures for income redistribution and regulation of the economy in the general interest; and welfare state provisions. Social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes. Due to longstanding governance by Social Democratic parties and their influence on socioeconomic policy development in the Nordic countries, in policy circles ""social democracy"" has become associated with the Nordic model in the latter part of the 20th century.Social democracy originated as a political ideology that advocated an evolutionary and peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism using established political processes in contrast to the revolutionary approach to transition associated with orthodox Marxism.
