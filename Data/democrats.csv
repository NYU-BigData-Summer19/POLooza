This is the easy way out rather than elaborating on the real cause. Lack of critical thinking, lack of meaningful discussion, lack of better platforms that break silos. It's easy to blame a scapegoat. There will always be men and women like trump, who will do anything and everything to latch onto power. The world will never stop producing them.

It's the responsibility of society to make everyone inclusive. An inclusive society will nip people like trump at their buds. The real problem is lack of awareness, lack of proper oversight on media, lack of punishment on the media for reporting false facts.

>2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.

>2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.

>2007-2009 - AT&T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.

>2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)

>2011-2013, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace

>2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)

>2012, AT&T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.

>2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

There was also a period (personal anecdote) where YouTube videos would not fucking buffer. I had to go through a proxy to get the videos to load normal. I had at the time 150 mbps download. There is no fucking reason that YouTube should have been loading slow back then.

Just because you personally are not aware of the issue, doesn't mean it wasn't an issue.

The shaping of the packets you request could be so incredibly slight, you might not have even noticed but they can kill a website. Make something take a few more second to load, and someone just might leave that website, and someone loses that traffic. That is a good way to hurt competitors in an almost hardly detectable way.

Meaning Pai's appointment was part of a trade. The GOP held almost every appointment hostage unless they got something.

Now you might argue ""Well Obama shouldn't have done that deal then."" But Obama's in a tight spot. Obama is the hostage negotiator in this situation. Worse: he can't just give up and tell SWAT to go in and shoot these particular hostage takers. He HAS to negotiate with them, because half the voters actually *want* them to do this stuff. So they aren't going anywhere.

You'd have to restrain them throughout so they can't deliberately miscarry. However it ends, you'll have to send these women on to regular prison to serve the remainder of their term, and thus find a home for the child (if a human is actually born here).

If you can't see yourself sending your pregnant daughter that sought an abortion to prison for 9+ months, then you don't believe that abortion is murder. It's as simple as that.",democrats,2,1515268441.0,comment

I understand you believe it is a majority, but in my experience, the people you describe are a vocal and visible sect, not the whole or even the majority. It's not good to write off a whole class of people as ""unsalvageable"" since you only create a more polarized environment and you do the same thing you accuse ""them"" of doing. You don't solve anything, you perpetuate the us vs. them mindset that hinders collaboration. You have to talk to the people who will listen. 

Picture this: Jim and Pam view themselves as conservative Christians. They read the Bible, go to church, and watch Fox News sometimes. They have genuine strong beliefs, and they would never vote for an adulterer, much less a hypocrite. HOWEVER, they are unaware that their congressman is both. They don't see beyond their sphere - they don't have anyone around them who isn't a republican, and when they talk in passing to other people they are insulted if they disagree with them politically, and are called hypocritical, mocked for their faith, but never have someone have a genuine discussion with them. Should they look beyond their sphere? Sure, and in my experience, some do, but Jim and Pam shy away from things when people are hostile to them. So the only people who actually talk to Jim and Pam are the scum like this congressman, their radical church mates, etc. and the polarization of society grows. 

We have to talk to each other and listen to each other if we want to succeed in this world. Yes, some people are going to be assholes to you because they disagree with you and write you off because of your beliefs. But you aren't showing them what's what by doing the same yourself - in fact, if you talk to everyone you disagree with with respect and the intent to change their minds you will, little by little, undermine those who do not by converting people to your side.

2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret.

The right understands implicitly that the best way to get people to continue to vote for you is advance their interests. 

A pro-life person will still vote for this POS because he publicly moves the policy needle towards their misogynist ideology. Upper middle class and upper class white men stay voting Republican because that Party has never deviated from advancong their interests since the 70s. The two previous Republicans that got ousted (Nixon and Bush I) were both perceived as inefficiently loyal to the base. Same with Romney. 

The Democrats always spew bullshit about ""bipartisanship""  or like Clinton (both of them), they fixate on appeasing and trying to peel off middle class voters. But then they enact policies that are so watered down that they help no one. Obamacare is a great example: pass a mealy-mouthed market based universal health care that leaves a lot of low-income people out while infuriating the Republican base. Obama was woefully naive at thinking the Red states would go along with the Medicaid expansion. They undercut him and whipped up their base anyway. They sent a message to their base that ""we care about your issue and will fight to the end."" All the Democratic base learned is that voting for Democrats is a crap shoot. But Obama and Clinton couldn't deliver for their base without alienating the Coastal donor class. 

The next Democratic President needs to embrace pro-labor policies, equal pay for equal work, universal pre-k and quality early childhood. If you have to reduce Defense spending that's fine. Better yet, dismantle the mass incarceration apparatus. If a Democratic President could do that then I don't give a shit how many celebrity and upper class pussies are grabbed if it helps the mass of single mothers, LBTGQ, and people of all color have a better life.

It's not as cool as you think to say ""Fuck christian values!"" to be an internet edgelord, and then go on to prove that you don't even really know what constitutes ""christian values"" as a contemporary term.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordeal_of_the_bitter_water

>A Sotah (Hebrew: שוטה‎ [1] / סוטה) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible.

As in, the story has roots in Judaism, not so much in christianity.

Other excerpts of that page:

>According to Mishnah, Sotah, 9:9 the practice was **abolished some time during the first century CE** under the leadership of Yohanan Ben Zakkai.

>Although, as with later Judaism, the actual ordeal was not practiced in Christianity it was referenced by Christian writers through the ages in relation to both the subject of adultery, and also the wider practice of trial by ordeal.

Also, for someone claiming that abortion isn't murder, to turn around and then claim that it is, you look a bit more foolish, if that is possible.

Since you're still failing to comprehend, I'll give it one more shot.

The phrase I was responding to was ""Fuck christian values!"". No disclaimer of which ones, so it would be just for one to assume the original speaker, if that was not your super genius(/s), that it was meant to fuck all the values, because, edgy is cool or some shit....

I am not speaking specifically as to abortion being murder.  I'm talking about christian values in general, because that was the comment I was replying to, and then I gave a couple of vague examples:  No murder, no theft, etc.

These values and other *are* good for society.  Again, if you wish to argue that point, **do so**.  Go ahead, tell me why we should just fuck those values, why we should just go ahead and allow violence, murder, theivery, etc.  Explain why you feel that ultimate anarchy is healthy for society.

Don't go citing irrelevant and obscure ancient texts to tell me what contemporary(modern) ""christian values"" are, especially something so ludicrous as a story about adultery that hasn't been practiced in centuries even in the Jewish faith where it originated....meaning you couldn't even really cite the correct religion.  I mean, you can if you want, but if someone else calls you a stupid asshole for doing so, they're not really being mean, just stating what's plainly observable.

You are making the mistake of thinking that pointing out some ridiculousness is somehow relevant to the conversation.  You sound like a fairweather atheist, one that doesn't know jack shit, but has taken the anti-christian stance because you somehow think it makes you better or smarter, because reasons.  Being ill equipped, you seem to regurgitate talking points you read from some other edgelord who's at least cracked a book or two.  ""I said some words that I don't understand, look how great I am!""  Arguing the way you are is why many atheist edgelords are seen as laughable pieces of shit.

A Sotah (Hebrew: שוטה‎  / סוטה) is a woman suspected of adultery who undergoes the ordeal of bitter water or ordeal of jealousy as described and prescribed in the Priestly Code, in the Book of Numbers, the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible. The term ""Sotah"" itself is not found in the Hebrew Bible but is Mishnaic Hebrew based on the verse ""if she has strayed"" (verb: שטה satah) in Numbers 5:12. The process was a trial by ordeal administered to the wife whose husband suspected her of adultery but who had no witnesses to make a formal case (Numbers 5:11-31). The ordeal is further explained in the Talmud, in the eponymous seventh tractate of Nashim.

dwqtgrx,"You really, really have to be completely out of the loop to not see the connection here. Trump has made deregulation and getting government out of business a centerpiece of his political career. He has talked time and again about lowering the tax burden businesses bear. That's like, 99% of his platform. 

So, now he comes out and suggests MORE regulation and MORE taxation for one particular company who just happens to own the media outlet which has been relentlessly critical of him. 

If this manchild somehow manages to cook up legislation or any other action from his angry shitroom tweets, it'll be direct retaliation on the press. It will be a direct attack on the free press. 

Granted...I doubt it'll come to that. I think he's just blowing hot air and being a dumbass, and I don't think he can rally the legislative branch full of Republicans to attack the richest dude on Earth. That just isn't how they roll. It's still pretty fucked up though. 

As far as liberals hating on Amazon for dodging taxes, being a shitty place to work, being a generally shitty corporate citizen...all that stands. But see, the left isn't so married to our ideas that we'll take them even when they come with a ton of baggage. I think that's the difference between left and right lately...the right will take a ""win"" no matter what. They don't give a shit that it betrays their other principles, so long as the win irritates at least one person slightly left of center. That's the only standing criteria the right has anymore for deciding whether or not a given political action is good or not. ",democrats,6,1522779963.0,comment

""High crimes *or misdemeanors*"".



In the context of the times, ""misdemeanor"" was a pretty broad term, up to and including just being awful at your job. 



Anyhow, the actual answer is that the Republicans in Congress who would have to do the actual impeachment prefer to keep him in office rather than remove the leader of their own party in what would surely be a messy, messy affair. ",democrats,314,1522771400.0,comment
dwr1mx9,"> Impeachment proceedings can only be started if he has committed a crime.

Flat out wrong. And there's no such thing as ""impeachment proceedings."" Impeachment is akin to an indictment. Indictments don't have proceedings.

More to point, Trump can be impeached for *any reason* -- for something illegal *and* for something legal, too.

That's because impeachment is a political process, not a criminal process. That's why there are no criminal punishments if the impeachment is successful; it's simply about removing the official from office. That's why an impeachment cannot be stopped by a court or appealed. It is an ""extra-legal"" process, a lawyerly way to say it's a process outside the judicial system.

""But what about the high crimes and misdemeanors language in the Constitution?"" you may be asking.

That is an archaic phrase from common law and does not literally mean an official must commit a crime or misdemeanor. An earlier constitutional draft included the phrase ""maladministration"" but the more commonly understood (at the time) phrase of crimes and misdemeanors was a late substitution.

As the Constitutional Rights Foundation says, [""on first hearing this phrase, many people probably think that it is just an 18th century way of saying 'felonies and misdemeanors.' Felonies are major crimes and misdemeanors are lesser crimes. If this interpretation were correct, 'high crimes and misdemeanors' would simply mean any crime. But this interpretation is mistaken.""](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html)

The phrase dates from the fourteenth century and, as the linked page explains, was used for actions that were both illegal and legal. In the United States, Congress has impeached and removed officials from office for ""being habitually drunk,"" even though that is not a crime.

Hence, the House of Representatives could impeach Trump for any reason they want, even if some or all of those reasons don't involve violations of the law. They could impeach him because he demeans the presidency, he demeans the country, he divides the populace, his behavior is intemperate, and/or his conduct is unbecoming of a President -- whatever the reason -- they have every right to impeach him for that and more.

Thus, they could impeach Trump for his pardon of Joe Arpaio, even if that is a legal act. They could impeach him for trying to stop Robert Mueller's investigations into his campaign, the Russian scandal, and more, even if such actions would not be considered sufficient enough to be criminal obstruction of justice.

dwqtxwq,"Under the federal constitution, no officer can be impeached unless for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" No impeachment proceeding in the US has ever been reviewed by a federal court, so we don't actually have any case law that says what this phrase means. It's important to understand, however, that at the time the federal constitution was adopted, the US criminal code didn't exist, so it can't be the case that the founding fathers wished to limit impeachment to those circumstances where the official committed a violation of this code. Rather, the best understanding of this phrase is that it refers to abuse of power, gross dereliction of duty, or misconduct that, due to its very nature, can only be committed by someone in a position of power (""high"" means great or elevated). So, to use Nixon as an example, firing someone who you have the authority to fire for the purposes of stopping an investigation of yourself. It's allowed, but clearly violates a fundamental, valuable principle that no man, not even the President, is above the law.

If it sounds very fuzzy, that's because impeachment is properly understood as a political proceeding with a quasi-legal veneer.",democrats,6,1522780334.0,comment

dwqidnx,"**Impeachment**

Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of government. Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office.

Because impeachment and conviction of officials involve an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office (election, ratification, or appointment) and because it generally requires a supermajority, they are usually reserved for those deemed to have committed serious abuses of their office.

It's the fact that he is transparently and obviously taking this stand because of the way he's been ""treated"" by the Washington Post.

You'd have to be either completely clueless or willfully stupid to pretend this is driven by anything other than him being mad at WaPo. 

Trump's entire political career is made up of him crowing on about deregulation and lowering taxes against big business. Outside of immigration, that's his entire goddamned platform.

And here he is talking about regulating and taxing *one specific business.* And that business just happens to be owned by the same guy who owns the Post? 

Given the way Trump acts...given his history of wanton vindictiveness....given his complete inability to let criticism against him just stand unanswered...yeah, you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe this isn't a directed attack against a media outlet. 

The fact that it's working to some extent...that Amazon's stocks are taking a hit...that's precisely why he's keeping it up. I don't think for one second that Trump is going to push for any legislation or even any kind of action on this issue. He won't try to tax Amazon. He won't try to regulate them. He won't try to change their relationship with USPS. What he *will* do is continue to tweet about how super-totes-bad Amazon is, because again...it's getting him the results he wants.

Speaking anecdotally, a lot of my American friends absolutely *bristle* at any criticism or notion that America is less than perfect.

So, of course, you're right that we can't tell people ""they're terrible"". But the first step, imo, would be for **far more** Americans to start actually analyzing and considering the problems with their democracy/system and how to actually solve it without devolving into paranoid delusions or knee-jerk jingoism.

Edit: In fact, you almost did the exact thing that I described. It was said (my paraphrasing) ""It's time Americans start to realize that ""American"" isn't synonymous with ""good"".""

Your reaction was that ""[we can't] convince people to vote Trump out by telling them they're terrible people"" Ok.. but wait... *who said Americans are terrible people*? All that was said was the ""American"" isn't universally synonymous with ""good"".

dd4wlpd,"As a rule, states have been hesitant to clean voter rolls for a few reasons.  Firstly, it has been used in the past as a tactic to disenfranchise 'undesired' voters by whomever was in power (pick a party).  You can put a process in place for getting back on the list of eligible voters, but draconian processes have been used in the past to dissuade people from going through the effort of getting back on.   

Second. If you do clean up the voter rolls, the people in power, ie they that ordered the clean up, don't want to look responsible for keeping Grandma from voting when she is accidentally kicked off the list of eligible voters.  Looks bad, pisses people off.

Third, it gets a lot of attention from outside groups and regulators, creating headaches for administrations people really would rather not go through for a limited return on effort, time, and keyly money.

Lastly, organized voter fraud has not been a problem in the US for generations.  So all the headaches above are hard to justify to your constituents and eats up time when you could be working on a legislative agenda or the grind of running a state.

**TL;DR**

Cleaning voter rolls was used as a tactic in the past to disenfranchise the opposition.  As such, it draws a lot of scrutiny, is administratively hard to do, and the kinds of voter fraud it addresses hasn't been a serious issue that could threaten the integrity of an election.  Little return on your efforts and a drain on political capital.

1. It's ""rolls"".
2. Doing *any* management of large lists is inherently error-prone, and so all you can do is choose what kind of error you're going to get: false positives (voters removed unjustly) or false negatives (voters incorrectly left on the rolls who probably won't vote).  

A good rule of thumb is that you'll get between 90% and 99% of the list right with a few quick passes -- the most common mistakes are things like ""We have a notification of death that includes last known address; they match a registered voter with the same DOB"".  You can safely remove that dead voter.  But what if the address matches and the DOB doesn't?  If you remove the voter, you might later find out it's a son/daughter/etc. who has the same name.  

Anyone who's ever had to do a property inventory or other large-list management will have plenty of stories about how much time and effort goes into the last 1% of every list.  If that time and effort were spent mobilizing voters or registering voters, the additional turnout would dwarf any potential fraud from the variance on the rolls.  ",democrats,4,1485869491.0,comment

It is also law in many states that if you are on government asistance this would allow for a voucher, not to mention just about any church would whole heatedly give you enough to cover one if you went in and explained the situation earnestly. The fees in the states that have them are more so you don't waste resources by being irresponsible and losing yor ID every other week.

dd5eiob,"Wow, your friend's mom is a moron. Penalties differ from state to state but generally involve a multi thousand dollar fine and prison time.

But here's the thing about your scenario. Voter impersonation only works if you know the voter you're impersonating exceedingly well. Imagine in the next election someone tries to vote in your place. When you show up to vote the rolls say you already voted. So, you raise hell, show the officer guarding the polling place your ID and then they launch an investigation. Odds are they'll never catch the perpetrator, but at the very least it's an easily recorded case of actual voter fraud. Even if they let you vote because they are keeping paper records, at some later point it's going to be discovered that you voted twice. The fact is that voter fraud of this nature is exceedingly easy to detect. So in order to pull it off without being detected you need to know in every single case that the person whose vote you're stealing is definitely not showing up to vote. (By the way, it's also super easy to detect votes cast by people who died before election day.) Now, try to scale this up to 10 people without ever being detected and you'll see why the fact that there have been 31 credible cases of voter fraud since 2000 shows that voter fraud is not a real problem.

When pressed on the matter to provide proof of this and/or any evidence at all, his first response was to... deflect to the democrats of course, but his second response was to claim that there are people registered who are dead and people who are registered in multiple states. 

He also cited this clown, greg phillips, who claims that there is *conclusively* millions of instances voter fraud, but couldn't offer proof because he didn't understand the difference between a theory and a conclusion.

>2. Voter ID laws typically require a potential voter to obtain an ID from a specific location or set of locations, in some cases that may be dozens of miles away (in the case of Texas, some people have to travel >100 miles).

You seem to have a lot of insider knowledge about the evidence the federal government has into an investigation about voter fraud, what branch of government do you work in? 

And in what possible way is voter ID a method to suppress the votes of poor people? If Mexico can do it, we can do it. If India can do it, we can do it. There is literally 0 reason to oppose voter ID, but the democrats do it anyway. Why? Because they rely on voter fraud. All I have to do in California to register to vote is click a checkmate next to ""are you an American citizen"" on an online signup sheet with no validation process. Project Veritas showed that there is voter fraud happening and that they've been doing it for years.

Most attempts at strict voter ID laws are designed specifically to make it difficult for minorities to vote. 

What happens is, They try to make laws making identification requirements much stricter while at the same time make it harder for people to get these ID's, sometimes it's already difficult enough that all they don't even have to make it harder to get, they just increase ID requirements. 

Minorities will often have less time to go through all the hoops required with these new voter ID laws, as they are more likely to have lower paying jobs which usually means they work more hours, or single moms  may not be able to spare the time or pay for child care. 

There are many other reasons why Voting ID laws affect minorities negatively, if you researched this subject even a little you would know that. 

If Republicans pushed to fund the creation of a national or even state  Voter ID and made it simpler and easier to get from a bureaucratic point of view, then i would say that indeed, it was just about voter fraud, but the reality is all these voter ID laws are designed to discourage minorities(who mostly vote Democrat)  from voting.

As I said too, not being religious but have done charity work with them, you would be hard pressed to find a place of worship that would deny giving you the $10 if you explained your ID situation to them.

2. I find it hard to believe there are people who cannot get a ride year round, but can make it to the polling place that one specific day of the year to vote. In addition the rural poor an elderly being far away from services to obtain an ID goes against the belief that the republicans are attempting to deny votes. Those people are their base. It doesn't make sense to actively deny those specific demographics voting rights, if that's the argument anyhow.

3. While some documents may be hard to obtain may be harder to acquire, getting a plain photo ID is relatively simple. A letter adressed to you, documents with your birthday and social security number are all that is needed. Given the required documentation that is needed for just primary school alone for decades, you would have to be raised more or less off the grid, with no medical care or use of money to be in this situation. Even the few people raised before documentation was stringent  would have to have been more or less recluses their entire lives, and have refected things like social security and banking.

I agree that getting the required ID should be free and easy. But the argument based on cost prohibitive voting denial just doesn't seem an issue. Examples are generally fringe theoretical cases are presented. Any cases I have seen are generally people who did make it a priority to register themselves to vote.  If the process were made perfect these are the people who would say that they should be able to vote after election day, after seeing the results, because they couldn't be bothered.

I mean given a perfect system, people would start claiming they were denied voting rights because they did not have the time to mail in post card to get their voter ID.

If he were merely suggesting a possibility, and had any credible evidence to support his claim, I would agree with you.  However, he's been insistent, again with literally nothing to back it up.  If he wanted to make a true investigation, he would *quietly* find a 3rd party investigator with no stake in the claim - not this Greg phillips idiot who can't even speak for 3 minutes on TV without letting his personal biases out in spectacularly moronic fashion, and not purposely fanning flames of hysteria among his voters to cast doubt on the democratic process and to stroke his own ego.  The US has already investigated many times the possibility of voter fraud from unbiased sources.  The reason THIS case has caused such resistance is not because people are ""afraid it's true"".  It's because the parties who are conducting the investigation have made it clear that they KNOW what the result will be and are seeking only to VERIFY it.  The issue with this is that when you have something to gain from one of the results of the investigation, it's impossible to actually conduct an unbiased investigation.  I know, typical liberals insisting upon proper investigative practices when voting rights are on the line. 

The complaint about voter IDs is that they will end up costing money.  They will ask that people take more time off of work to go get them.  They will likely make them take as long as possible to fill out paperwork etc.  You may think that's not a big deal, but that is a much larger inconvenience for people with lower income than it is for people who earn more.  Trump benefits from this.

I'm also in California, and I also registered online, so I know that what you are saying about simply clicking a bubble is actually total BS.  It's not an incredibly involved process of going and waiting in a line and paying extra fees unnecessarily like it is in many states, but they still ask you to provide a valid driver's license, the last 4 digits of your social security number, and a name and address.  All of these are checked against eachother to make sure they match a registered citizen.  It's very possible there are isolated instances of people using someone else's ID, but it's impossible to vote twice, and it's impossible to vote if you don't have the credentials of an actual citizen (unless they were to steal someone else's identity).  Certainly not up in the millions of illegal voters.  

Also, laughable that you even mention project veritas as some sort of evidence.  Those guys have been shown multiple times to have doctored footage and stoop to insanely unethical levels to conduct their ""investigations"".  Most recently, they were caught on film attempting to bribe progressives to start a riot at Trump's inauguration.  This is well known, and this is the reason Donald Trump isn't sitting on ABC news saying ""You know James O'keefe?  Yeah, that guy totally proved what I'm saying is right."" - because he would get torn apart immediately.  It would only give him more public attention which would further discredit him.

So you say all of this with absolute conviction, but you've provided a straight up falsehood and evidence from a known fraudster to support your points, so... again you're back to nothing.  Can you provide anything of substance while you tell me what I'm saying is bullshit?

And since voting laws are well established by law to be states rights issues, all Trump would do with it is use it as propaganda to say how terrible all those liberal states are.

dd53nc9,"No, it wasn't JUST the electoral college system that cost the vote, that's oversimplification. It was a culmination of a lot of different factors that caused it, just a few off the top of my head:

- The handling of the email controversy
- The handling of paid speeches and not releasing transcripts
- Bernie or bust
- media spotlight on Trump
- calling half the population deplorables
- Hilary being, frankly, a bad candidate with too many flaws to pick out.

Any change or difference in damage control could have swung a point or two, but all of this formed into a death ball that put Trump into power. Saying that it was just the electoral college takes away the whole year of campaigning that was done.

A computer could easily check it against a government database on-site at polling locations to make sure you are who you say you are, that you are not deceased, and that you have not already voted. If the Photo is the sticking point, that's easily remedied by using the photo locations in US post offices to submit a photo to a government database. They're already set up to handle it, as this is one of the primary ways people get their photos for a passport. Allowing a photo to be submitted by mail would also work, and is currently good enough for passports as well. This would remove the burden of the state having to issue a whole separate card.

Surprise, but not everyone owns a car.  In fact, a large percentage of people in the inner city don't own cars.  And when you have places like North Carolina and Alabama specifically closing offices in low income areas, means that just to register to vote take a large chunk of time  (in the middle of work hours, no less, so they have to take time off of work).

If someone doesn't have time they don't have time. People have to get driver's licenses no?  

You obviously didn't even bother to read anything i linked to, not surprised  as you seem like someone who has no interest in educating themselves, especially if it contradict your world view. 

all you have is your assumption on what people can do and personal attacks, also your claims of being a minority and using that as some kind of proof of anything don't mean shit, I've seen plenty of times where users claim to be a minority and that they agree with some insane conservative narrative only to go through their history and see that they're white, often they're even white supremacists,  not that I'm  saying you're not a minority, but your personal experience doesn't invalidate the majorities experience. 

here's two examples when Courts ruled Voter ID laws illegal, it's not just a fantasy of mine, this is real life. 

[A federal appeals court struck down North Carolina’s voter ID law on Friday, finding that a series of provisions approved by lawmakers in 2013 were “enacted with racially discriminatory intent.”](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/nc-voter-id-law-discriminatory-appeals-court/) 

[Texas’ voter identification law violates the U.S. law prohibiting racial discrimination in elections, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.](https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/20/appeals-court-rules-texas-voter-id/)

You can't have a discussion about *anything* if you are not going to allow objective facts to be the basis of a policy discussion. 

Think about how far to the right the American so-called ""center"" is. The largest socialist program in like, 30 years at least, has been Obamacare. Which is almost unrecognizable as something on the socialist continuum. It isn't single-payer, national healthcare, which is now the norm for developed nations. Look around worldwide, how is our current republican party different from any far-right political party that is currently surging in Europe?

If one is willing to overlook or disregard the xenophobic and racist rhetoric coming from the people currently inhabiting the white house, then I submit that such a person is, whether they know it or not, racist.

I think that the disconnect arises because conservatives think that you have to be dragging minorities behind a pickup truck or wearing bed sheets to be a ""real racist"", and when the overwhelming majority of people who enable or perpetrate racism don't do those things it *feels* unfair to be called a racist. It is this limited view of what constitutes racism that is the problem.

This is also precisely the mindset exploited by the GOP. Voter registration isn't racist because it doesn't mention black people explicitly. The rhetoric of ""school choice"" to divert money away from public schools isn't racist because it doesn't mention black people explicitly. Predatory lending isn't racist because it doesn't mention black people explicitly, et cetera. It is a broader view of the term racism than most white people have ever considered.

This was a middle of the night into Pakistan territory without their knowledge raid with less-than-100% confidence he was there, and they had to use elite special forces with super high tech stealth Blackhawk helicopters. I mean, if there was ever a time not to make the move, this was the time the President could get a pass. And yet President Obama made the tough move. And actually, I don't blame Obama for this, but because the operation went a bit south with the crash of a helicopter, new technology was exposed to the world, but what better time to have a coming out party then killing Osama Bin Laden?",democrats,-2,1504776224.0,comment

This is where you are wrong. He said he would give money to Harvey victims (12 organization, one of which has ties to Trump), but he didn't and he won't, because fuck them, why would he? You can not trust this man's words, but he is POTUS. I'd be nice to have an american president whose words actually mean anything, because at this point you can safely ignore anything Trump says and focus on his actions, which are terrible.

And if he magically decides to actually give the money (remember he is an alleged billionaire, 1 million is supposedly peanuts for him) away (which he is absolutely not known for), I will still be unhappy, because he funneled a bigly larger amount of tax payer's dollarinos into his hotels, so he still made a profit by simply abusing the presidency - those millions (**your money**) would have been great for disaster relief, tbh, but they are probably either funding his campaign rallies (this early?) or his businesses.

Here's a link to the responses:

I count **250** places that Trump has claimed to have donated to that say he's lying. Another 64 that didn't respond and another 100 that refused to say. Judging by the other 300 places on the list I'm going to say the 100 that refused to say just didn't want to anger the president.

The debate isn't about whether or not global warming is real or not, it's about if it's due to human activity.

NASA says it's 95% likely to be the result of human activity.

ICSC says human activity has no impact on global warming.

There's a lot of shaming going on on the issue of global warming. You even included some shaming yourself ""Fuck you, you're brain dead"", like you're afraid of being wrong. When this happens people who believe ICSC's studies go silent, which makes it seem like people who believe the NASA studies are right.

du2s1tk,"**Non sequitur (logic)**

A non sequitur (Latin for ""it does not follow""), in formal logic, is an invalid argument. In a non sequitur, the conclusion is either true or false, but the argument nonetheless asserts the conclusion to be true and is thus fallacious. While a logical argument is a non sequitur if, and only if, it is invalid, the term 'non sequitur' typically refers to those types of invalid arguments which do not constitute logical fallacies covered by particular terms (e.g. affirming the consequent).

du2sjad,"The USA leaving Afghanistan at the time would have caused Afghanistan to collapse again because the Taliban HAS a sponsor and result in another terrorist ""zone"" that would have to be invaded again. 

The issue was simple. The first war in Afghanistan made real progress. But wasn't romantic. So we got a war in Iraq. Which sucked resources away from Afghanistan which allowed the Taliban to call on old favours and honour to reform their system. 

We didn't press the attack and we certainly didn't put pressure on a certain country that was arming them. ",democrats,28,1518349396.0,comment

du2tzqu,"Well, he’s the president otherwise I would never think about him or talk about him. I didn’t even know how outspoken he was on Twitter until he ran for office. I had no idea he was so political. He’s also proven he doesn’t want attention but positive attention, the guy has a temper tantrum on Twitter every time a public figure says anything negative about him. 

The smartest thing he did was go from running as a democrat to a republican. He found a base much easier to fool and ran with it. All he had to do was repeat everything he heard on Fox News the night before and boom, he’s president. 

Hopefully his regime wakes up apathetic Americans and they prevent something like Trump from happening again or he’s just the beginning of wannabe authoritarian candidates on the right. Hopefully, it’s the former...",democrats,11,1518353206.0,comment

e5p0q6v,"2018 Russia Investigation Current Tally:

Guilty By Trial: 
- Paul Manafort (Trump’s Political Consultant) (8 Charges) (10 Charges Mistrial)

Guilty By Federal Judge:
- Alex van der Zwann (Worked with Rick Gates and Paul Manafort) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty:
- Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor) (1 Charge)
- Rick Gates (Trump’s Political Consultant) (2 Charges)
- Michael Cohen (Trump’s Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair) (8 Charges)
- George Papadopoulos (Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel) (1 Charge)
- Samuel Patten (Associate of Paul Manafort and Cambridge Analytica) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty (Wanted To, But Denied Guilty Plea):
- Paul Manafort (Tried getting guilty plea after his first trial (Found guilty on 8 charges while the 10 other charges are still ongoing). My opinion/guess is He was denied because Mueller’s team probably already knows what he was going to tell them.

Recused:
- Jeff Sessions (Attorney General)

Granted Immunity:
- David Pecker (CEO of National Enquirer/Trump’s friend) (Pecker claims there is a safe of decades of damaging stories of Trump. Rachel Maddow touched on how the National Enquirer repeatedly put out anti Hillary cover stories. “Control the medium, control the message.”)
- Allen Weisselberg (CFO of Trump Organization)
- Andrew Miller (Roger Stone’s Aide)

Granted Immunity (Manafort Trial):
- Donna Duggan (Moody Insurance Worldwide Employee)
- Conor O'Brien (Former KWC employee)
- Cindy Laporta (Paul Manafort’s Accountant)
- James Brennan (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)
- Dennis Raico (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)

A. This investigation is ran by Democrats!
- President is Republican
- House is Republican majority
- Senate is Republican majority
- Rod Rosenstein is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican
- Robert Mueller is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican 

B. This doesn’t have anything to do with Russia!
- The investigation is still ongoing (We’re only 1.5 years into the Trump presidency. Watergate took 2 years.)
- Paul Manafort has another trial a separate trial in September. I wonder what that could be for?
- Michael Cohen said explicitly he has evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government. Treason is a crime and a crime treated by capital punishment aka the death penalty.
- TRUMP'S Campaign manager, TRUMP'S National Security Advisor, TRUMP'S Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel, TRUMP'S Political Consultant, and TRUMP'S Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair were all indicted. The TRUMP Organization CFO got an immunity deal. The National Enquirer CEO, TRUMP'S good friend, also got an immunity deal. AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP? Everyone in he has surrounded himself has either flipped, found guilty by trial, found guilty by a federal judge, plead guilty, recused themselves from the Russia Investigation, or has been granted immunity.
- Why are you so quick to dismiss someone of possible crimes?

C. Cohen's Guilty Plea from the Justice Department states (Says he has evidence to prove):
https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-eight-counts-including-criminal-tax

- “The plea was entered followed the filing of an eight-count criminal information, which alleged that COHEN concealed more than $4 million in personal income from the IRS, made false statements to a federally-insured financial institution in connection with a $500,000 home equity loan, and, in 2016, caused $280,000 in payments to be made to SILENCE TWO WOMEN who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, thereby intending to influence the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.""

- “The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, Title 52, United States Code, Section 30101, et seq., (the “Election Act”), regulates the influence of money on politics.  At all relevant times, the Election Act set certain limitations and prohibitions, among them: (a) individual contributions to any PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, including expenditures coordinated with a candidate or his political committee, were limited to $2,700 per election, and PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES and their committees were prohibited from accepting contributions from individuals in excess of this limit; and (b) Corporations were prohibited from making contributions directly to presidential candidates, including expenditures coordinated with candidates or their committees, and candidates were prohibited from accepting corporate contributions.""

- “COHEN caused and made the payments described herein in order to INFLUENCE the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  In so doing, he coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.  As a result of the payments solicited and made by COHEN, neither Woman-1 nor Woman-2 spoke to the press prior to the ELECTION.”


D. George Papadopoulos on Jeff Sessions and Russia:
- “While some in the room rebuffed George's offer, MR. TRUMP NODDED WITH APRROVAL and deferred to Mr. Sessions who appeared to like the idea and stated that the campaign should look into it” - Defense Attorneys for George Papadopoulos (Former Foreign Policy Adviser, who plead guilty in trying to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin)


E. George Papadopoulos on Russia Trump-Putin Meeting:
- “I actively sought to leverage my contacts with the professor to host this meeting. The CAMPAIGN WAS FULLY AWARE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, including Corey Lewandowski (Former Trump Campaign Manager) and Sam Clovis (Trump Campaign Aide/Former  Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics For United States Department of Agriculture).”

Here are the options:
Option #1: Everyone in Trump's inner circle, opponents of Trump, and anyone that speaks negatively of Trump is a liar, according to Trump? 
Option #2: Trump is a liar and a criminal﻿.





Things TRUMP’S White House hires have said about their boss, TRUMP:
- “A fucking moron” - Rex Tillerson (Former Secretary of State)

- “An idiot. ""It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had” - John Kelly (Chief of Staff)

- “An idiot and a dope” - H.R. McMaster (Former National Security Advisor)

- “An idiot surrounded by clowns” - Gary Cohn (Former Chief Economic Advisor)

- “He’s like an 11 year old child” - Steve Bannon (Former Chief Strategist)

- “An empty vessel when it comes to things like the constitution and rule of law” - Scott Pruitt (Former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency)

- “His mental decline could not be denied” - Omarosa Manigault-Newman (Political Aide)

- “Fucking liar” - John Dowd (Former Personal Lawyer)

And people from diverse backgrounds also typically go to a wider range of educational institutions (not just the Ivy's), which also leads to intellectual diversity.

Racial diversity is not a great proxy for diversity of opinion due to the fact that race or ethnicity is a fairly arbitrary distinction.

An example would be if you took a sampling of a people from an upper class suburb of varied racial and ethnic backgrounds and asked them about their life experiences it would be more similar than if you repeated the study for people of the same race but of different socio-economic status. 

The fact is that a diverse group of representatives is no better than a group of “non-diverse” representatives. What makes a representative effective is successfully fighting for the interests of individuals in their district. ",democrats,5,1546573307.0,comment

If you only have white males in your legislature, you're only going to have issues addressed that affect white males.

By having both racial and gender diversity, you increase the chances of addressing issues of concerns to all citizens, not just those of a specific gender and race.

>We're pretty much all white where I live

If you have an all-white country, then you'll have an all-white legislature, just like an all-Asian or all-Black nation will have legislatures of a single race.

America’s population or “Diversity” as you call it shouldn’t be reflected in gender or colour but in character. Isn’t that what Martin L King was trying to teach you? That a man or woman should be judged by the content of their character and not by the colour of their skin?

Seems like you are pushing further away from the sentiments of Mr King and going back to focusing on the colour of skin for diversity. If this is what you need to fulfil your goal where do you stop? What representation would be enough? Do you need 60% white of which 50% will be female and within that 50% brown hair and within that 70% brown eyes and so on? 

The point I’m trying to make is if your idea of diversity comes down to appearance you will never be done with trying to fulfil your diversity quota.

Curious how someone lecturing me, an American, on what it means to be an American is using non-American spelling.

>Isn’t that what Martin L King was trying to teach you?

What I see is someone who clearly does not understand the writings and teaching of Dr. King. I find it deeply offensive that you would try to claim that he would be more satisfied with a nearly all-white, nearly all-male group of legislators as being somehow more diverse than a group of legislators that was *actually diverse*.

Notwithstanding that crowd of nearly all-white, all-male individuals has a long history that's hostile to women and persons of color, so when it comes to character, theirs is pretty piss-poor.

>The point I’m trying to make is if your idea of diversity comes down to appearance 

I am a mixed-race woman. You seem to think that ""appearance"" is what separates gender and race and that superficial things common to white people like hair or eye color is the same as being of a different or mixed race. And then you're assigning that idea to me and debating that -- it's called a straw man argument.

I don't recall any history of red-haired or blue-eyed people being codified in this country as lacking rights or legal standing. I do, however, know a long history of people of different races being subjected to discriminatory legislation. That is why equating eye color with race is patently ludicrous.

",democrats,11,1546576767.0,comment
ed78b8c,"there is no ""diversity quota."" it's about making a level playing field for all participants involved. its been overwhelmingly clear that white men have dominated the political, social, and economic playing field for the better part of america's history. dr king is correct in saying that people should be judged by the content of their character and not by the colour of their skin but it's clear that the white skin color has been prioritized in americas history. you cannot argue against that. as such the need to bring in other races is necessary.

""diversity"" means including all equally. the fact is is that the playing field is not equal at all, as seen in the picture, and the most we can do is elect as diverse of a population as possible in order to start evening the field. ",democrats,-2,1546574199.0,comment

ed79fig,"Ok so there is really a lot in this. 

So I believe it is a minority of people that that truly think diversity is good for the sake of diversity. They believe it has no merit other than to ensure that the face of a race or culture is on an oil painting somewhere.  Personal I believe most people don't really do much for ""Fighting for diversity"". Anidoticly I work in an environment that normally requires a large staff. The majority of the time the leadership at the top (Dir - SrVPs) are white males. Yet they end up with a rather diverse workforce. Most of the companies do in fact have diversity guidelines, however, they tend to be simply put ""don't NOT hire someone cause of race, creed, sex........). The point is that while yes, there are people that go out and cause problems if the ratio of minorities to the majority isn't 90/10. They are rare... and personally, I call these people extremist.  That being said, there is the same group on the other end of the spectrum.   


Yes, some with good intentions, lose their way... what is it, Harvard, that just got sued cause they wouldn't let someone in cause they have too many of their race already? Yes, it complicated, but I doubt it was this whole... we want and have to let people in cause we have a quota.  Its more the idea of not discriminating got out of hand.   


Now the kicker is you may hear about how the other side is full of these Extremist all the time. ""Ohh the Dems want to open the border and let EVERYONE in!"" , ""Ohh the GOP is just going to raise your taxes and cut all social services!"", "" So get out and vote and make sure the Dem/GOP doesn't take this right from you!""  I'm sure you've heard it time in time again. Yet every few years a single party controls the House, the Senate and the Presidency and none of these things have ever come anywhere close to happening.  Additionally, if you sit down and talk to the average person I'm sure they would agree they don't want those measures. Most people, on both sides, want smart immigration control, smart gun control, and a sensible tax plan. Even if the politicians tell you otherwise.   


The point is, we react to this fear that the other side is some nut job. Yet really they are our next door neighbors or the guy we talk sports with at the office. They just point that go on their way and just have a slightly different view of how things could be.   


I don't know if I really explained my self well enough, it's getting late here. But I hope you can follow it. 

And, yes, I'm a democrat... and really every democrat that I know... tends to feel the same. We really don't want open borders or to completely take away your guns. We simply want a path to citizenship that works and sensible gun control that keeps the nut jobs from getting their hands on them. ",democrats,12,1546575228.0,comment

I think diversity isn't desirable because it lowers social trust, cohesion, and participation. It leads to unnecessary and uncomfortable policy contortions that aren't based in reason. It permanently damages long term cultural continuity which in turn shortens the lifetime of a society. 

It's a pretty simple idea (people who share the same traditions, values, and beliefs typically get along better than those who don't), however, there's a large body of peer reviewed publications on this topic. If you're interested in learning more [this is a facile primer](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/)

It seems like if Wheeler--the guy who was misquoted and is now suing about it--was present at the meeting, it probably doesn't make sense to conclude that the meeting shows White House collusion in the lie. This could have gone down like:

Spicer: Hey, long time no see. What're you up to?

Butowsky: we're looking into who murdered Seth Ritch

Spicer:  hoo boy, you catch 'em yet?

Wheeler: nope 

Spicer:  dang. Well, how's things otherwise?  You see that sports game the other day?

dl1s31k,"That would be an editorial pushed by Israel and blamed on the Russians.  
It also does not mean they are incorrect.  
  
Twitter deleted, or hid, the u/panda4bernie account which was was Seth Rich's.  
We saw the content on it for a day or two before the story blew-up and Twitter got rid of it.  
u/pandas4bernie was created in 2017, this account combined with deleting the real account, was presumably to sow confusion and lead people to your conclusion.  
  
This is also where and why Kim Dot Com enters the picture.  
Maybe KDC is just grabbing headlines, but if we admittedly swallow a big pill here and give him the benefit of the doubt ... he acted as an intermediary between the leaker and Wikileaks. The leaker had a panda-related account name and sent the material to KDC. Once Seth's love for pandas become well known KDC figured out who it was that sent him the material.  
  
I feel it is also important to mention that there were multiple ""leaks"". The material sent to Wikileaks which the DNC and Hillary and Podesta have confirmed is their email and then the Guccifer 2.0 documents which are forgeries and were published publicly on Word Press, not Wikileaks.  
Podesta clicked on a phishing scheme that linked to a Russia-hosted website; this was after he forwarded a suspicious email to IT asking if it was legitimate and IT replied and told him it was legitimate ... but that was a typo and the guy meant was **not** legitimate. His emails ultimately ended up on Wikileaks as well. Again I would point to Israel as the most-likely source of government espionage in making this happen.  
  
It's a bit beyond me why Hillary and Podesta would admit their emails are authenticate given the activities described therein.  
They could have just denied they were real. The only thing that would add-up is-if a large number of people in Congress et. al. and all being blackmailed and coerced and this was a way to start to leak the information. I do believe DWS in particular is being coerced. All of the real evidence points to DNC IT as a heavily compromised organization and if that is that case they could have dirt on a great many DNC staff and personalities.  
  
Rumors are Imran Awan was arrested by the FBI.  
A beacon of hope if it is true but I haven't been able to confirm beyond the abundant sources of compromised ""news"".",democrats,1,1501653583.0,comment

Yes, he was given a heads up.  Like I say in my original statement, it's not uncommon for journalists to give politicians a head up when a big story is coming that their team may have to respond to.  As for the lying - There's no law that says they have to answer every single little question, or do so truthfully.  Seriously.  This isn't a courtroom.  You don't have to like it, but it's true and it's useful sometimes. What capital crime is it to deny knowledge of something if a reporter asks you?

It's a republican trait for almost 50 years running now.  Still, newspapers will give administrations(either party) a heads up sometimes.  It keeps their relationships running smoothly.

The Killian documents controversy (also referred to as Memogate or Rathergate) involved six purported documents critical of U.S. President George W. Bush's service in the Air National Guard in 1972–73. Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a 60 Minutes II broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the 2004 Presidential Election, but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents were forgeries. No forensic document examiners or typography experts have authenticated the documents, and this may not be technically possible without the original documents.

Fact one.

* Foreign Agents Registration Act Financier and former Russia investor William Browder testified at a hearing on the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). This law requires those representing the political interests of foreign powers to disclose their relationship. Mr. Browder told committee members that the Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. was heading Russian efforts to get sanctions under the Magnitsky Act repealed. The act blocked Russian government officials and businessmen associated with the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky from entering the U.S., froze assets in U.S. banks, and banned the use of American banking systems.

Fact two.

*  Donald Trump Jr. releases 'entire email chain' regarding Russian meeting

Fact three.

*  Trump dictated misleading statement on son's meeting with Russian.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump dictated a statement, later shown to be misleading, in which his son Donald Trump Jr. said a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 was not related to his father's presidential campaign, the Washington Post reported on Monday.

They (Trump and his administration) admitted this today.

The undisputed facts about the June 9 meeting point to clear intent to coordinate with the Russian government’s covert intelligence operation to influence the election. The apparent eagerness on the part of the most senior members of the Trump campaign to meet with Kremlin-linked figures; the willingness to acquire and use material provided by the Russians; the failure to report the meeting to U.S. law enforcement; the subsequent repeated public denials that any meetings with Russians had occurred; the misleading statements made about the meetings in the face of evidence that they had occurred; and the denial of any Russian election interference demonstrated that the Trump campaign was a willing and capable partner with Moscow in its covert influence operations targeting the election.

e6rq8nb,"Judging by quite a few comments here, it seems like a lot of people didn't actually watch the hearing. Kavanaugh's opening statement was incredibly emotional, and there were quite a few moments where he was choking back tears and struggling to maintain his composure.

To make this clear: **I'm not here to make a judgment about what might have happened between Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.**

I just think it's not exactly a ""good look"" to say that the people in this picture are disgusted. That's a blatant misrepresentation of the truth. The people to Kavanaugh's right are his family, as far as I know, and they were seen to be struggling just as much as Kavanaugh was during the more emotional moments of his opening remarks. 

tl;dr: Don't misrepresent the truth. It's incredibly easy to do, especially in settings where there are cameras snapping off dozens of photos every second. It reminds me of that photo from not too long ago where Trump was surrounded by other world leaders, and they were looking at him with rather serious/chastising looks on their faces. Another photo from a few moments later showed them smiling and laughing. A few seconds is all it takes to provide a photo which can be used by either side to forward their agenda, whereas the truth is likely somewhere in between those two extremes. I guess this wasn't much of a tl;dr, but yeah. Just wanted to toss in my $0.02.",democrats,26,1538096600.0,comment

I believe what she said this morning, and I started to find him credible when he was reading his statement. The range of emotions were completely understandable: the anger at first, the frustration then the sadness and upset at times. I felt for him. He then started to show this level of disdain and disrepesct for the democrats asking him questions and that's where he lost me. He is trying to become a supreme court justice and I guess I just expected a certain level of decorum. 

As part of my job, I sometimes have to work with individuals who have difficult personality disorders. I will bend over backwards to assist them, and they will run to my Director to complain. I didn't do anything wrong, it's just the way some of their brains are wired that making someone else's day a little worse makes theirs a little better. So, after they bash me to that Director, I have to meet with that same person who complained about me and said nasty things. I can't let on that the personal jabs bothered me, or he/she will complan that they feel uncomfortable complaining. I see these individuals for years having to deal with this cycle.

He started bridgwater hedge funds, he is one of the smartest investors ever. He explains the state of our economy very well. He breaks it down and says there are really 2 economies, the bottom 60% and the top 40%. The bottom 60 is having a very hard time getting by and the top 40 are making more money then they have ever made. This is why the economic reports show our economy as thriving and in a great position but that’s only true for the top 40%. Now his answer to this is for the under educated and lower class to have principles and morality and make decisions based on there principles not there emotions. Also our education system is a wreck, AI is going to be taking over a lot of jobs here soon and kids need to be learning how to write code and other skills that will prepare them for a good job in the future, just because AI is coming does not mean there are not going to be jobs it just means we have to change our skills and mindset from working against AI to working on and with AI. If you look up Tony Robbins podcast he has one on there also very good info on economics and what needs to change to help that bottom 60%. Also please realize there is always going to be a top 1%, the only difference is in socialism and communism there government employees. Castro family is by far the richest family in Cuba, daughter of Hugo Chavez’s is the richest person in Venezuela. I don’t think it’s bs that these big corps exist, they do provide jobs and services, what the problem is when they mix with politics and the politics makes rules to benefit the corporations over the people.

dqzrywz,"**Just-world hypothesis**

The just-world hypothesis is the assumption that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, or order.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the English language in various figures of speech that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: ""you got what was coming to you"", ""what goes around comes around"", ""chickens come home to roost"", and ""you reap what you sow"".

dqzw2qd,"There’s not regulations that stop them from investing. Investing is what they do, in fact. They give to charity, in part to offset taxes (or donate to their church). Recently, there was a chat some of them had to see if the lowered taxes would go to jobs or investment. The rich admitted they won’t be making more jobs. Investment alone does not necessarily create jobs. What’s more is that a lack of regulation and taxation on the wealthy at the cost of the lower classes has LITERALLY precipitated every major economic downturn in the past couple centuries. It doesn’t work. 


What’s more is, and I’m from the area that I am speaking about, when we look at constantly poor areas, like Appalachia, investment doesn’t come into those areas from the wealthy. They pull their businesses out, despite tax incentives from cities and the states. Industries leave, creating a class of jobless citizens trapped in a place with fewer jobs than people who need them. The despair, paired with lingering injuries from the nature of their old jobs, leads to depression and medication abuse, which created the Opioid crisis as we know it in the Appalachian region. It’s expensive to invest in these impoverished areas; the rich don’t want to do it because of the cost. 

We could remove every regulation on the book and that wouldn’t change BECAUSE it’s expensive. There isn’t a line of wealthy people waiting at the gates for these institutionally poor areas. The best way to raise up the poor is to give them the means for them to do it themselves in the best possible way. How is that done? Through institutions like head start, educational grants, and improving public education through increasing their budget, as well as offering affordable healthcare and the like, we could see massive growth in economic mobility. Instead, we feed the rich what scraps we can from our tables when they have a feast in front of them and then try to scramble and catch what crumbs fall to the floor and THAT would make things better?

In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input. In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed.

The term appears to have originated in the early 19th-century United States (particularly in the phrase ""pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps"") to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.

Dog-whistle politics is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The phrase is often used as a pejorative because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently distasteful to the general populace. The analogy is to a dog whistle, whose high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from ""code words"" used in some specialist professions, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm.

The American suburb has by and large been afflicted by the first. Economic segregation caused a divide to allow that thought to grow.  School systems were then segregated for several generations and ignorance to others not white and not well-off bred unaware racists.

They're view is literally one cul-de-sac to the next.  They are just smart enough to be ahead based on their parents white privilege and success but just ignorant enough to not know why they became racist and classist.   Fox and Breitbart prime viewership. They then vote down tax increases for education and to help others in need because why give away money. That's why so many suburban schools are now broke or needing vouchers to subsidize the revenue because their base voted down education. And because they never needed help in the suburbs financially, they literally can't fathom anything other than the safety of their lives so everyone else is just lazy.  This class and these ignorant racists are the bulk of the elite's sheep. They are bought and paid for by fear and loathing created by the ultra wealthy preying on their daily routines of their media, the corporations they work at and and God.  It's fucking terrifying because they are the ones who keep the powerful in power without realizing it.

dqzpkzt,"Welfare is not ""socialistic"". I understand that is the propaganda present in capitalist society, but it's simply not true. Socialism is a mode of production. Capitalism is a mode of production. They are antagonistic. Socialism is intended to replace capitalism through revolution. Capitalism is when the capitalist class makes money by exploiting labor. Socialism is when the workers own the means of production. Neither one can exist in the other. 

Welfare incentivizes the laziness that capitalism created. I'd work even if didn't have to. In fact, I literally work today in hopes of working for myself tomorrow. It is human nature to work freely. Capitalism estranges people from working freely so that they don't fulfill their human nature. Consequently people end up hating work because it is associated with subservience. 

The inflation from UBI would come from the demand curve shifting right. Consequently with more demand the firms would raise price to cash in. This also assumes massive centralization of the firms because the only way UBI would be implemented is a future capitalism whereby all of the industry is essentially in a few hands, probably monopolies. Consequently, the firms would by knowledge of consumers having extra money increase prices.

dqzwk6g,"Well, considering it only applied to people making over 2 million dollars in a year, they are already making literally enough money that they could work for one year and then retire for the rest of their life.

90% is likely too high, even for a top marginal rate that only applies on income earned beyond the first 2 million (when adjusting the previous level for inflation). But 50%, for instance, would likely be fine.",democrats,1,1512830723.0,comment

dm5hfmn,"Let's just look at some numbers for executive branch members under the past few administrations.

Obama (D) - 8 yrs in office. Zero criminal indictments, zero convictions and zero prison sentences. Amazing!

Bush, George W. (R) - 8 yrs in office. 16 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 9 prison sentences. Yikes.

Clinton (D) - 8 yrs in office. 2 criminal indictments. One conviction. One prison sentence. That's right nearly 8 yrs of investigations. Tens of millions spent and 30 yrs of claiming they were the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime. Clinton clearly lied under oath, was impeached, but not in the Senate and not removed from office.

Bush, George H. W. (R) - 4 yrs in office. One indictment. One conviction. One prison sentence. Pretty good for a Republican, one term wasn't enough time to do real damage. Remember this in a couple years, please.

Reagan (R) - 8 yrs in office. 26 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 8 prison sentences.

Carter (D) - 4 yrs in office. One indictment. Zero convictions and zero prison sentences.

Ford (R) - 4 yrs in office. One indictment and one conviction. One prison sentence.

Nixon (R) - 6 yrs in office. 76 criminal indictments. 55 convictions. 15 prison sentences. Impeachment initiated in the house but resigned.

Johnson (D) - 5 yrs in office. Zero indictments. Zero convictions. Zero prison sentences.

If you were keeping score, 

Democrats in 20 years...3 criminal indictments, 1 conviction, 1 prison sentence

Republicans in 28 years...120 criminal indictments, 89 convictions, 34 prison sentences.

So whenever I hear people whining about how corrupt the Democrats are compared to their holier-than-thou Republican party, it drives me a little more insane.

dm5fwef,"**ATF gunwalking scandal**

""Gunwalking"", or ""letting guns walk"", was a tactic of the Arizona Field Office of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which ran a series of sting operations between 2006 and 2011 in the Tucson and Phoenix area where the ATF ""purposely allowed licensed firearms dealers to sell weapons to illegal straw buyers, hoping to track the guns to Mexican drug cartel leaders and arrest them"". These operations were done under the umbrella of Project Gunrunner, a project intended to stem the flow of firearms into Mexico by interdicting straw purchasers and gun traffickers within the United States. The Jacob Chambers Case began in October 2009 and eventually became known in February 2010 as ""Operation Fast and Furious"" after agents discovered Chambers and the other suspects under investigation belonged to a car club.

The stated goal of allowing these purchases was to continue to track the firearms as they were transferred to higher-level traffickers and key figures in Mexican cartels, with the expectation that this would lead to their arrests and the dismantling of the cartels.

Donald Trump is an American businessman, television personality, author, and President of the United States.

An analysis by USA Today published in June 2016 found that over the previous three decades, Trump and his businesses have been involved in 3,500 legal cases in U.S. federal courts and state court, an unprecedented number for a U.S. presidential candidate. Of the 3,500 suits, Trump or one of his companies were plaintiffs in 1,900; defendants in 1,450; and bankruptcy, third party, or other in 150. Trump was named in at least 169 suits in federal court.

dm5gbf6,"**ATF gunwalking scandal**

""Gunwalking"", or ""letting guns walk"", was a tactic of the Arizona Field Office of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which ran a series of sting operations between 2006 and 2011 in the Tucson and Phoenix area where the ATF ""purposely allowed licensed firearms dealers to sell weapons to illegal straw buyers, hoping to track the guns to Mexican drug cartel leaders and arrest them"". These operations were done under the umbrella of Project Gunrunner, a project intended to stem the flow of firearms into Mexico by interdicting straw purchasers and gun traffickers within the United States. The Jacob Chambers Case began in October 2009 and eventually became known in February 2010 as ""Operation Fast and Furious"" after agents discovered Chambers and the other suspects under investigation belonged to a car club.

The stated goal of allowing these purchases was to continue to track the firearms as they were transferred to higher-level traffickers and key figures in Mexican cartels, with the expectation that this would lead to their arrests and the dismantling of the cartels.

durkdso,"I wouldn't have a problem with Trump dodging the draft because the draft was fucking stupid and the war in Vietnam was bullshit, but he is such a prick about it and he says that he feels like he was in the military because he went to a military prep school, he disrespected John McCain's record as a war hero, he said he knew more about ISIS than the generals. He acts like he *did* serve in the military even though he didn't.

And as for that cop, I have just a little bit of sympathy for him. He should have gone in and tried to save those students at the risk of his own life, that's the job. At the same time, though, he didn't want to die. As a cop in a school I don't think you ever expect to have to get into a firefight with a guy armed with a semiautomatic rifle, and if you aren't prepared for that it's hard to say what you'll do when the time comes. If people want to call him a coward it's cool, I don't think that's inaccurate, but they should also call every cop who shoots an unarmed man a coward too instead of defending them and pretending every cop is a hero, because they're trying to do the same thing: save their own asses instead of doing the very dangerous job they signed up to do.",democrats,408,1519494877.0,comment

It stopped investigating. It stopped asking tough questions. It stopped doing its job.

Fox was conceptualized as a propaganda wing of the Republican Party. It was and is. CNN and MSN had to compete with the 24 hour news cycle model, and have since devolved into propaganda wings of the democratic party.

Both sides can point out hypocrisy by the other networks. But they're both pushing a bias and fake news bullshit.

I don't  fault Obama and left wing pundits making fun of FOX and pointing out how full of shit they are. And we can't fault Trump for pointing out the same crap by all these networks.

Trump, however, I'm not entirely sure what his strategy is here because a significant part of his base already wildly distrust the media from years of Republicans already driving this campaign. 

The wisest know that both sides of the media are biased and that they must digest from both. Each side of the media works to portray their side in better light than worse and the opposing side in less light than better. Just this time around, Trump makes it rather easy for the non-conservative media. A good portion of people do not digest both sides which explains why a good portion of the conservative base legitimately believes Trumps is more right than wrong.

The propaganda goes so deep that no one is catching that Fox News was airing FAKE NEWS by covering a film that itself is making false claims about immigration effects in Sweden.

We should be mad at Fox News for this, then the President, in that order.

The level of propaganda that we are at now is causing us to not question wtf Fox was doing, (media are friends right? Or was it enemy?)

People need to get a hit of super knowledge on the extent of propaganda we are up against.  Some incredible discoveries about how they are being deployed on a technology level was recently reported here.   Reading this might allow you to hang in longer:

Already at that other place they are saying liberals are calling Trump a liar because he cited a Fox News 'Report' - passing that report as the 'real news'.

ddxpiiu,"You need to concentrate all your efforts on the rural downticket, is what the fuck you need to do. 

This party has all of it's eggs in a half dozen major metropolitan baskets, none of which have enough electoral power to get the job done, which I'm sure you've noticed.

I can't even elect Democrats in my 40k population town because I only have a straight Republican ticket to vote on with no options. That's how hard you've given up on most of your downticket.

Ohio's going to lose its one Democratic Senator in two years if you keep doing what you're doing. One more swing state gone blood red. Your party needs to leave it's urban fortress in a bad way.

So, yay, sure, seize the moral high ground and all that. But protesting and making yourselves feel good in the towns you've already won is just going to leave you in tears like it did last time.

John Boehner called that an ""easy ass election"" and he was right. But you insisted on Clinton, the only person in the world who could possibly lose to this asshole. And most of the nation feels like they never had a party to vote for in the first place.

Here's a stupid idea, maybe concentrate on getting the working class vote back by talking about how you're gonna help them make money. If you want black people to feel like their lives matter, great. Prove it by putting the money in the pocket where the money goes. The whole damn country is feeling broke as hell. Fix that. Make that the only thing you care about.

You have rapidly become the party of rich white college graduates from the city with jobs nobody but you understands. Or worse, they understand your jobs just fine, and that you are nobody's friend. Looking at you, HR department.

You might want to reconsider that. Or maybe you focus on social issues so hard because it's the only spot where you can feel like you have the moral high ground. Maybe dwell on that.

Do you think I came here from That_subredDit to fuck with you? 

I voted for Clinton, Gore, knocked on doors for Big O and you know I voted for him twice, and then voted for Clinton again anyway. 

So how about you all fuck off about waving signs and all this other crap that makes you feel excited and gives you a chance to socialize but doesn't accomplish anything, and concentrate like a laser beam on making sure you have strong Congressional candidates, and *that your voters show up to the polls*.

I would suggest making triple damned sure people know about absentee balloting if their state allows it.

And if you don't do all this out in flyover red state scary country, you are screwed, do you understand? It's not good enough to give up on 80% of the national acreage and just hold your little fiefdoms. Some of you might need to pick up and move back home. Learn how to live without Uber. Drive your own car like some sort of backwards peasant. Realize how fucked most of these towns are since all they've got left are jobs that you are personally going to obsolete with your STEM degree. 

Just because there's a heavy ""screw Trump"" mandate going into this election doesn't mean it automatically goes to you. These are not normal times. Don't pretend like the R's are on their way out while you control a teensy little corner of Congress and fuck all else. Do not get cocky. Do not repeat the mistake Clinton just made. 

You've got a minority of Congress, no President, no more Barack to save you, no damn governors outside of California and a few other states, and most of the country's small town government is controlled by the Red Hand Of Death.

Your pyramid has no bottom, and you are in deep soup. Get your people to the polls in two years, and think small. Think mayors in tiny towns. Hundreds of them. Think state governors, 50 of them. Thousands of small time elected positions, all of which you should be trying to win. All I can do is vote. 

You have to put viable candidates on ballots and back them hard, with money and support, out in the boondocks where all the Democrats have fled.

This next presidential election is not a gimme. You had your gimme. You blew it. You had the Obamas working all of their magic on your behalf and still. The R's were all screaming for Barry's head for 8 years, and somehow he still got his second term. So did Bush before him. It is *unlikely* that Trump will be a 4 year President.

And be nice to the Republicans. I know you don't wanna. I don't either. Every little interaction you have with the other side of the fence is going to determine the course of history. I want you to go watch that last John Stewart video where he talks about how this is still the beautiful America it always was. Be nice. Don't be an asshole on Twitter.

I said don't be an asshole on Twitter.

Do I need to say it again? I hope not. Because if you feel like you can't, then maybe no more Twitter.

I cannot believe the future of the world has come down to that damn website and yet here we are. 

Get your rural voters out to the polls for tiny little elections you don't care about. Make sure they know if they can absentee vote. Make sure they have people they can vote for, and make sure they know their names. Pimp for Govtrack.

That said, please understand how a major news organization works.  There are multiple departments with editorial staff working hard to report the news. If the NYTimes, or the Wall Street Journal ran a story about him, yes, it was probably for your click, because it was in the ""entertainment"" news department of the organization, probably run by someone you'd want to drink a beer with (if not the editor, the actual writer of the piece).  Yes, they are chasing clicks.  This is the reality of not dishing out $1.25 for a newspaper. 

But, in the same organizations, there are a dedicated, independent, group of actual journalists who are chasing and reporting the news as they find it when reporting on news of critical substance.   

I highly recommend that anyone who reads this take advantage of their university or local library's free digital access to the more reputable and established news organizations available.

ddxoki5,"It's not that you can't believe anything; it's that you have to do your own research (in everything).

I can't tell you how many misleading findings I've come across for my career because the people conducting polls have agendas or bias or are pulling from too small of a sampling or are tactically pulling from a specific group to illicit leading results.  I work in data analysis, and there are so many false positives, but where there is a lot of smoke there may be fire.  Especially when coming from multiple resources that I've come to know as reliable, which will prompt me to do my own investigation.

Take everything you see (not just the news) with a grain of salt.  Pewdiepie's case is one of clickbait, which you will find with many of the worst organizations.  

It invalidates a lot of the argument, and even though I am a Democrat, I get pissed off by this sensationalizing shit that some news outlets and shows do.  We need a civil discussion to have Republicans and Independents alike understand where we are coming from.  Not like what the Daily Show has become.  I can't stand the rhetoric they spew:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCRY_tOPQ7Q

That video is the worst example of journalism (which Jon Stewart was able to do deftly, so maybe I am spoiled from his helming of the show).  They had Tomi Lahren on and were able to have a somewhat civil conversation with her, but focusing on dumb shit like Trump's hands or calling him Hitler (which won't reach many Republican's ears at this point) is the wrong approach.

We need to cleanly and simple explain what Trump has lied about, while also acknowledging any shortcomings of the media or anything else he attacks.  There are some outliers, but thankfully not many, so we can turn this discussion to our favor.  It requires that we do the research though, and spend time patiently and calmly discussing with those Trump supporters around us if and when we can.",democrats,1,1487503061.0,comment
ddxob2c,"It's paid shills and useful idiots. 

Have you heard of the 10% rule? Says only about 10% of people actually participate in social media, the other 90% just watch. Why is this relevant? Well it makes the internet an easy platform to game. There is monetary incentive for companies to use web crawlers to monitor what people are saying about them and to control their public image using bots and shill accounts. 

Monsanto did this a lot a few years ago when people started to question their business practices. Not only would you get downvoted for saying anything negative about Monsanto, but you would get called an idiot conspiracy theorist too (and many other not so nice things). That way anyone who questions monsanto will automatically be lumped in with anti-GMO and anti-Vax nut jobs. Monsanto doesn't seem to be nearly as active as they once were.  Lot's of companies do similar things especially Microsoft. And to be clear, these companies don't have shilling departments themselves, they outsource to third parties (the way the Clinton campaign used Correct the Record). 

The same thing is happening now with BLM/SJW culture vs alt-right culture, except instead of controlling their public image, they're attempting to shape the social and political narrative. And it's not just them, lots of organizations are competing to control the narrative. BLM mostly consists of ""useful idiots"" -- people who have no idea what they're fighting for but just want to latch onto a cause. government organizations (NSA, KGB, Etc..) are also attempting to shape the narrative. Oh and we can't forget organizations like ISIS too. 

The worst part is, many of the elites are in on it, they know it's happening. they know the things we see on social media/the internet are all being controlled by competing organizations and aren't organic, yet they ignore it because they are hoping that the narrative they are pushing will win out. 

Russian spy organizations and American spy organizations (and spy organizations from every other country) are able to use bots and sock-puppets, but also hack into peoples digital lives and steal personal information used to black mail them. Most of our politicians are idiots who don't understand technology, they're sitting ducks. Politicians, celebrities, leaders of BLM, etc, are all vulnerable  to being blackmailed and doing someone elses bidding, especially in the days of the internet. 

Our security organizations aren't security organizations, they don't keep us secure, they keep us insecure so that we can be hacked and blackmailed. 

Most race relations in the US are the result of Russian interference:

- Russia uses state sponsored shilling to game and control social media like Reddit and 4chan. They do this to try to control the political and social narrative to create a culture of unrest. They are responsible for the ""SJW"" authoritarian culture that the alt right complains about and they are responsible for stirring up the alt-right by exposing them to anti-white media.

- It's not just paid shills by Russia, the US and many other nations (UK, Germany, China, Israel, ""Five-eyes"", and many more), organizations (Microsoft, Apple, ISIS, Monsanto, Big Oil, etc), and individuals (trolls, idiots, crazy people).

- There are also some people being manipulated into believing that there is widespread hatred of white culture by non-whites and non-white culture by whites, these people further exacerbate the problem and are what's known as ""useful idiots"".

- The emergence of so called ""socialist"" sub-reddits is the result of anti-western forces likely being controlled by Russia to cause people to lose faith in capitalism and vote for more monolithic social programs or get rid of the American business culture altogether.

- There is a world wide cyber war happening right this minute as you read this, it's been ongoing for some time, and it's about to get ramped up.

- The goal of Russia is to de-stabilize the west and especially the US

**BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS COMPETING TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE AND NOTHING ON THE INTERNET REPRESENTS THE WAY THE 90% OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T POST AT ALL FEEL.**

He also does the reverse, which is the promotion of news articles and obscure bloggers who are blatantly making shit up (no, the unemployment rate is not 50%, 3 million illegals did not vote, and Hillary Clinton did not give Russia 20% of US uranium supplies) because they support his untruthful narrative.

It talks about how Disney ended their relationship with Pewdiepie because of anti-Semitic jokes and imagery in his videos. That's 100% what happened (full disclosure I don't pay for WSJ so I've only seen the free part). He paid two guys to hold up a sign that said ""death to all Jews"". Do you think Disney wants that shit on their network? Pewdiepie also posted [this Tweet](http://archive.is/sKiji) in which somebody asks him ""When did you become a Nazi?"" to which he replied ""aryan, superior genetics since birth"". Now I'm totally on board with that all just being (kinda shitty) jokes. But again, it's fucking Disney. He should understand that if he wants to be associated with Disney he can't have that shit going on. It's common sense.

The only thing that is remotely WSJ's responsibility in this, is that they contacted Disney (presumably to ask for a comment) about the anti-Semitic content on Pewdiepie's channel. But getting mad about that is basically calling them tattle tales. Pewdiepie's an adult and he (and no one else) is responsible for what he does and says. 

Again, to restate: dropping Pewdiepie was Disney's decision. Putting Nazi shit on his channel was Pewdiepie's decision. If you want to work with Disney it's common sense that ""death to all Jews"" is not a smart thing to put on your channel. End of story.   ",democrats,19,1487499373.0,comment

He used a video of Hitler and compared it to the YouTube Heroes program saying the program was like Hitler by recruiting users to report videos. The WSJ used that against him.

He created a video showing gamers creating swastikas on the walls in his gameplay and told them to stop writing swastikas - the entire video was ""Stop writing swastikas in my games"". The WSJ used footage of that against him as supporting evidence for their claims.

He even just lifted his hand in the air (with his hand not in the shot) and they used that footage too.

The black bloc people *are* the organizers in your current model. When you go to a progressive demo you are supporting them.

You can outflank them by having mainstream progressives organizing things instead. As I said, that was what was done all over Europe in the 20th century.

>In any case touching a black bloc is assault. People have been charged with assault for removing protesters from private meetings. Times are different and laws are different.

Please. It wouldn't be a problem to remove KKK-guys through legal means, removing antifas is no different.

ddxppq2,"Thanks for responding! And even more politely than I did! I'm gonna respond to a couple points you made, so this might be a little disjoint. Furthermore, I have an aggressive way of speaking, so please don't think I'm trying to attack you.

First topic: H3H3 and PhillyD. I am also a fan of h3h3, and I think he's really funny, along with idubbbz. Frankly, I don't think they have added much substance to this issue. The points I saw were basically ""I know he isn't anti-semitic,"" and ""He's a comedian and they took him out of context."" I don't think these points have much merit. He isn't anti-semitic, but he is pushing graphic language onto the screens of children. Saying ""oh, he's a comedian"" really ignores the makeup of his audience. This isn't Patton Oswalt or Dave Chapelle, this is PewDiePie, maybe parents OK-ed him out 3 months ago, before he took up this new 'bit.'  
I think most other Youtubers are obviously gonna take his side, it's always convenient for artists to say all art is fair. Idubbbz had an interesting point recently, which was (paraphrasing him after he said the N-word): ""If she called me out for lazy, immature jokewriting, I wouldn't have a response."" That's what this is, and it certainly doesn't handle a sensitive issue with the respect it deserves.

Second Point: Gamer. I really disagree. He obviously isn't just a gamer, and even if he were, I hardly think Xbox live chat should be the moral benchmark to which we hold children's entertainers.

Third Point: Words only matter if we let them. I couldn't disagree more. Maybe you are Jewish, maybe you are ok with people making these ""jokes"" around you (I'm being pretentious and quoting ""joke"" because all he did was have people who barely speak english repeat horrible things). Do you think we should be ok with this message reaching 10, 9, 8 year old Jewish children? Is there anything that shouldn't be said? What about less obvious 'jokes' like ""we need to kick <racial slur> out of the country""?

ddxmaws,"All those stories are almost certainly true. 

Regarding disarray in the White House, three members of Trump's team have resigned, including the head of the national security council (Flynn). The guy Trump chose to replace Flynn (Harward) turned the job down. Those are facts, they're not fake, they're not lies. It's the truth.

Regarding the national guard story, the leaked memo the media based their stories on is right [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3467508-Trump-National-Guard-Draft-Memo.html). The WH claims it was never seriously considered, but somebody clearly considered it enough to write it.

The ""EO being unconstitutional"" isn't even a news story. It's the decision of the court that ruled on it. You can disagree with their ruling but it's not the media saying it's unconstitutional, it's the judges -- incidentally, judges are the people who decide what is constitutional.

Regarding Flynn, this is where I'm going to call you out: You get your news from Breitbart, don't you? Breitbart ran a story recently that claimed Flynn hadn't broken any laws and was completely cleared. **That was a fake news story.** The FBI's investigation is ongoing, but Flynn at the very least violated the Logan Act (doubtful he'd see criminal charges for that but it's still true).

Since the majority of gun related deaths are suicides, any reasonable gun control policy should address mentally ill and especially potentially suicidal individuals - the very group Trump deregulated when it came to the ownership of guns.  Taking Trump at his word, isn't the better question:

I have a personal stake in the arguments put forth by discussing gun control and the democrats ideas on curbing freedoms is scary to me. People talk about the republicans not wanting to store a bunch of data on people to make instantaneous background checks easier, but then they complain that some dem politician signed legislation to monitor people's communications or some shit. I was a hard left leaning person. I still am I think, I support things like basic income and a form of socialized healthcare. But apparently I'm on the right because I believe that if you want to qualify for state or federal aid, you have to do something for it(like mandatory community service until you can find a job that will pay you your livable wage on top of basic income, if you can't afford your food and housing after basic income, you're fucking up and that's on you.) 

Gun rights too, I'm a felon from a car accident I got in when I was 17. I'm not a violent person, never had any other charges beside a marijuana possession charge recently. I would have zero issues obtaining a firearm. They are everywhere. I could literally have one today. The law says I am not allowed to have one so I do not own one, nor do I plan to until it is legal for me to do so, but there's my issue. I feel like I would be a responsible gun owner and I have faith that I will get my rights back someday. Maybe 30 years from now but then I can at least go hunting. But because of a situation out of my control when I was 17 I have to relinquish my rights to bare arms. 

What if society collapses here in America? What if Trump gets impeached and his millions of loyal followers decide that America was stolen from them and we delve into a second civil war? Do I just hope me and my family is safe? Do I go illegally obtain a weapon to protect myself and my loved ones? Do I just say fuck it and let someone decide to take my life because I ran a stop sign I couldn't see when I was a kid and caught a felony?

dpffg6k,"There are already provisions in place for the waiting period you describe. When you request a NICS check, you can get one of three responses: ""Proceed"", ""Refuse"", and ""Hold"".  A proceed response allows the seller to complete the sale immediately. A refuse response prohibits the sale entirely. A hold response gives law enforcement up to three days to provide a proceed or refuse response. If they fail to provide any response after the ""hold"", the sale is allowed to continue. (This prevents a de facto gun ban by simply de-funding the NICS system.)

If the sale continues without a proceed response, and it is later discovered the buyer is prohibited, law enforcement can recover the firearm and charge the buyer. 

None of that happened. Despite his ~~felony~~ *domestic violence* conviction, he **passed** the background check.

That texas does not mandate background checks for private sales is irrelevant, because he **passed** such a check. 


What needs to happen now is an audit of the NICS system. If they didn't know about his conviction, we need regulations for reporting such convictions to NICS. If they did know and failed to refuse the check, someone needs to lose their job, and possibly be charged for their negligence.

The policies of many on the right are unfortunately at the root of a lot of the causes of violence, which is exacerbated by guns, but as an extremely liberal gun owner, let me tell you that the policies of many (not all) on the left are often very poorly thought out, fail to try to make incremental improvements without unduly restricting constitutional rights, and are often enough attempts at end-runs around due process and actually meaningful reform.",democrats,34,1509989129.0,comment

The fact is everyone, or the vast majority, wants a society full of healthy people. The way of doing this is either universal healthcare provided by the government or a health insurance system that works the way it is supposed to. 

The health insurance system would be ideal since competition would theoretically lower cost and improve quality. But that hasn't happened. Instead manipulative billing, unrealistic prices, and the possibility of still ending up bankrupt even with insurance all point to that system failing. 

The alternative is government provided healthcare available to anyone, which sounds like a paradise, but is vulnerable to the same price gouging as private insurers. 

There needs to be a complete reform of medical care in the US before either system will work. Incentivize people to *prevent* illness, instead of just run to a doctor to treat it. 

That type of change won't happen with the stroke of a legislator's pen though. The first step I would like to see is some kind of tax credit or subsidy for things like gym memberships, diet or nutritional programs, pet ownership, ethics courses, etc.

dpg1suq,"A Bad Conduct Discharge and a Dishonorable Discharge are two completely different things. 

Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD)[edit]
A Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD), can only be given by a court-martial (either special or general) as punishment to an enlisted service-member. Bad conduct discharges are often preceded by a period of confinement in a military prison. The discharge itself is not executed until completion of both confinement and the appellate review process.

Virtually all veterans' benefits are forfeited by a Bad Conduct Discharge; BCD recipients are not eligible for VA disability compensation in accordance with 38 CFR 3.12.

Dishonorable[edit]
A dishonorable discharge (DD) can only be handed down to an enlisted member by a general court-martial. Dishonorable discharges are handed down for what the military considers the most reprehensible conduct. This type of discharge may be rendered only by conviction at a general court-martial for serious offenses (e.g., desertion, sexual assault, murder, etc.) that call for dishonorable discharge as part of the sentence.

With this characterization of service, all veterans' benefits are lost, regardless of any past honorable service, and this type of discharge is regarded as shameful in the military. In many states a dishonorable discharge is deemed the equivalent of a felony conviction, with attendant loss of civil rights.[16] Additionally, US federal law prohibits possession of firearms by those who have been dishonorably discharged[17] per the Gun Control Act of 1968.",democrats,2,1510005883.0,comment

As for how they figure the gun was sold illegally, this can be done with sales records and serial numbers.

The police look at the gun for the make, model and serial number. They will then go to the manufacturer to get the information on the FFL they sold to. They will trace this all the way to the final customer purchase from retail.

Now the cops check the sales records that the FFL selling the gun is required to maintain for 20 years on all transfers they facilitate.

This will get them the name of the buyer so they can contact that person and pull their background check.

If that customer is your bad guy, case closed, you know where they got the gun. Then it can be determined if the background check was done. All really simple up to this point.

Instead of 'assualt weapon' it could have been referred to as a 'CA restricted device,' or 'CA controlled firearm' or something like that. Using 'assault weapon' is an attempt at manipulation, not leadership, and doesn't impact the underlying laws which use the 'assault weapon' definition.

Firearms are used far more often to frighten and intimidate others than for self-defense. Guns in the home are also used more often to intimidate or threaten other people living in the home than to defend the home against crime.  

Nearly all criminals that report ever being shot say they were shot by police or other criminals. Virtually no criminals report ever being shot by law-abiding citizens.

Firearm use by crime victims is also not shown to be any more effective at preventing injuries than any other protective action.

Gun violence is violence. It doesn't address the core issue of violence itself or why things take place. If you want to live a free society, you must admit that someone will always be able to do what this guy did or Las Vegas did.

That's freedom. What I'm more concerned about is the everyday gun violence that happens, over 85% of it is either suicide or drug related violence.

What I mean is, most surveys conducted about DGU only account for the defenders perspective and if they felt like in an incident where a gun was pulled did that help to prevent harm. Many critics can state and have stated that most sample sizes were small and that bias may have been a factor. Or like someone below me has pointed out, perhaps from a more neutral perspective, the gun use by the defender wasn't for protection but rather escalated the situation themselves by producing a gun.

Joyous. It sounds a lot like the republican mantra, just missing one step: ban, subsidize, socialize risk, privatize wealth.

You need to come up with some. Republicans can rely on being 'status quo' with no ideas (that's the whole point of conservatism), but you need to actually come up with some ideas that work. Not the same ideas that don't work.

And no, no one cares if the republicans did x to ruin it. Come up with something where republicans don't either a) want to mess with it or b) are unable to mess with it using limited government power.


This is literally your party job. Try better. Try different.


>  I'm going to guess it has something to do with ""individualism"", ""liberty"", and ""market based"".

Yeah, god forbid I look to an individual's right to determine their own life and have the liberty to make choices.

And god forbid we have a market where you can make choices for yourself.


I mean, what is this? America? Pssh, we've never had that before. In fact, little known fact, before Reagan was president, we were a collectivist state with a sprawling welfare state.


Are you joking?


Also, that feeling when Denmark AND Sweden AND Norway AND Switzerland all have more market oriented solutions than your nation and your leftist party thinks they're bad.


Can you come up with ONE market based approach to a single solution in the US? Just one? I'm starting to think this is why you are unelectable. It's like you have this nation built on the literal tenants of capitalism, and you suddenly decided it was all bad because since 2000 the inequality has started.

So by 200 years of progress towards open capitalist markets ....and let's throw that away for a system of progressive authoritarianism the Swedes abandoned in 1993. All because of 20 years of bad regulation, both on the parts of each party. Doesn't matter who 'did it worse'.

ebpb4on,There was a major problem around 2000 with illegal immigration into the USA by people illegally crossing the border rather than overstaying visas. At which point the border fencing was considerably improved and as a result there was a significant decrease in illegal crossings. Since then there has been a drop in the number of all types of illegal immigrants so it is no longer the major issue it was in 2000 and any additional border strengthening really doesn't do anything to stop illegal migration compared to the huge costs.

These types of attacks would stick harder if they focused on the ethical implications and either the work not getting done or the issues with him vacationing at these places (the ""kitchen cabinet,"" BS security for classified materials, etc), or the hypocrisy of him being so critical of the amount of time Obama vacationed.  

People hear ""most people take 12 days but the President has taken..."" and they tune out.  The President isn't ""most people.""  His job isn't ""most jobs.""  Personally, I want my President to take vacations to help rest his/her mind.  Obviously, this is obscene but the argument distracts from that part of it.

This specific attack was used against Obama who did actually take more vacation than ""most people"" too.  But it was a bad attack because he was still productive and there wasn't the ethical issues.

So what? His role is not based on production. The Executive branch is not a factory and you can't treat it as such. I hold the same viewpoint for Obama's time outside the White House. For an Executive, it's all about policy. He's done some intentional good, he's done some accidental good, and he's done a fair amount of bad.

Campaign talk is definitely a thing, but he was throwing insults at Obama way before he decided to run.

Personally, if I owned (and enjoyed) a resort, I'd probably stay there if I was a politician. 

To a degree I agree with this. Most big name politicians *will* benefit off of their office through book deals, paid speeches, and so on. I don't expect a Trump to never make money off the office - every politician does including Trump's opponents Bernie, HRC, and all the republicans he ran against in the primary. However I think there is a big difference between publishing a book and making money off of the secret service staying in your hotel. If you write a book about your time in office, someone *chooses* to publish it and people *choose* to buy it. The secret service and all other government officials who travel with trump aren't making an active choice to stay at his hotels - Trump chooses to go to Mar a Lago and the SS *needs* to pay to stay there to protection and his staff *needs* to pay to stay there to provide support. There is also the added concern that people can essentially pay to have access to the president by buying a membership. 


Also, even if trump is equally productive at Mar a Lago, he is spending significant more of airfare and SS and Cost Guard protection costs by taking these trips. To me if feels disingenuous for a politician who is constantly talking about cutting national debt and cutting funding to Social Security and Medicaid to be spending 1.5 million a month on airfare - half a million more a month than Obama.

Camp David is set up for the President to go to and is already secure and is already paid for by the tax payers. It is also located relatively close to The White House and does not require Air Force One to get to. The cost of a President going to Camp David is not extravagant and does not benefit anybody or any company.

Disney is not owned by Trump so if he were to go, he is not reaping the benefit of having the government pay his own company for his entire entourage (secret service, assistants, other necessary people) for hotels, food, golf carts, etc. Also if any President were going to Disney as often as Trump goes to his own resorts people would be outraged.

The argument is that Trump is using the office of the President and all the things that go along with it to enrich his own company and thus enrich himself.

drsbx9d,"I don’t wish to disagree with you because I’m in agreement. But I am compelled to point out that Trumps opponents are far more mobilized than his followers, and it will remain that way. The opposition party is always mobilized when the other side is in office; it would be weird if it wasn’t. This time, however, it’s much more pronounced due to all the trump hate is hypermobilized relative to other past White House regimes. But whenever someone says something like “nobody wants him in office” I feel that it needs to be pointed out that the statement is incorrect. Were that to be true, he never would have been elected. Take a look at all the videos on YouTube since his election, compiling all the people that laughed him off and completely disregarding him as a candidate. One sticks out in my mind, Bill Meyers show had Ann Coulter on,  this was before trump even won the nomination. Coulter stated she believed Trump would be the nominee and everyone at the table laughed at her like she was retarded. 

That’s the kind of attitude that gets people like trump elected. That, plus a wrecked DNC putting forth the worst possible candidate to run against him. Unless we change the attitude that we’ve had since before the election, that he’s a joke and nobody wants him in office, we will have him in office for a second term as well. He should never be underestimated. We should have learned that last November. ",democrats,4,1514315889.0,comment

Ok! So... you want take rich peoples money? Ok! Let's do it! Let's really do it... It cost about $4 trillion to fund the federal government for one year! Let's start January 1st!
 
12:01 AM, January 1 The only thing more evil than a rich person in the eyes of leftists is a rich corporation. Let’s take the two most evil of all: Exxon Mobil and Wal-Mart! Forget high taxes – let’s just take every penny of their combined 2010 global profits: $34 billion dollars! Now we’re talking! Spending all of their money gets us from midnight on January first to:
 
9:52 AM January 4 Okay, not as impressive as we hoped. So let’s now take EVERY SINGLE PENNY OF PROFIT from the other 498 fat cat companies on the Fortune 500 – ALL of it. That’s  $357 billion! That’ll get us to…
 
2:00 AM February 9 Okay, we’ve taken every dime of profit from the big companies, and it’s only Super bowl time. So let’s grab the obscene corporate advertising –  $250 million! — which will run the country for… 36 minutes. But why stop there? All the ad money on all 45 Super Bowls – that’s five billion dollars – gets us to:
 
2:00 PM February 9 Well, it’s obvious we can’t do this just on the backs of corporations. So if we’re going to soak the rich, lets start with the obscene sports salaries. Take all of the salaries from the NFL, NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball – not their endorsement deals, just their salaries – throw in all of the winnings on the PGA tour and redneck, knuckle-dragging NASCAR as well… That’s 9.4 billion, which gets us to…
 
1:00 PM February 10 Forget athletes… I mean, take all their money, but they’re not enough. Let’s get the rich! Let’s take 100% of every penny that anyone makes above $250,000. I can hardly wait. Let’s see:
 
A: Number of US households: 116,000,000?B:
 
Percent of households above $250k income: 1.93%
 
Number of households above $250k income: 2,238,800
 
Total income of households in excess of $250k = $1.412 trillion
 
Now we’re talking! Eat the Rich! Take everything everyone makes in America above 250k, which gets us from February 10 until…
 
6:00 PM July 2 Well, obviously we’re going to have to cut some spending. Let’s just stop paying for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – that’s where the money for health care goes, right? Into wars for oil? Not another dime; just bring ‘em all home. That would save us $105 billion Afghanistan and $159 billion in Iraq, a total of $264 billion – enough savings to cover us until…
 
4:00 AM July 29 Summer blockbuster season! Hey, we need the money, so screw you, Star Wars: take every penny in movies, toys, lunchboxes, etc — $25 billion – which gets us to…
 
4:00 PM August 1 Now God knows Hollywood has been good to the left, but they’re no longer useful idiots – they’re just idiots now. So, let’s evict everyone in Beverly Hills and sell their homes at current market value. 15,000 homes at $2 million per gets us another $30 billion, paying the bills through…
 
4:00 PM August 4 This isn’t working. Michael Moore assured us that there’s plenty of money. And that it’s all tied up in the rich. So liberal billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates – tough luck for you. $100 billion between them… they accidentally fall down the stairs at a public sector union rally, let’s say, and through inheritance tax we keep 50% of their loot — another $50 billion, enough to get us to…
 
4:00 PM August 9 All right. Let’s get serious: there are 398 more billionaires, according to the latest Forbes 400, with a combined total net worth of $1.29 trillion. A few hundred more accidents at 50% death tax – kill ‘em all and take their estate tax  — that’s another $650 billion. Good until…
 
4:00 PM October 13 Still not there. Okay, forget this namby-pamby 50% nonsense. Kill all the billionaires and take all of their money. Take everything from the next 100 or so of the almost-billionaires, and that buys us an additional 73 days until…
 
4:00 PM December 25 Christmas! Almost there! See how easy this is? Now remember, this is for America’s poor, so in the spirit of Christmas let’s get rid of foreign aid. This saves $50 billion – getting us to…
 
4:00 PM December 30 So near and yet so far: we’ve still got a day and change to pay for. To cover the remaining $12.5 billion we’re going to have to hit every American man, woman and child for $40 to pay for that final 32 hours. Which gets us to:
 
12:00 AM January 1, 2012. We did it.. Happy New Year, everybody! Now what? Who’s gonna hire you to work... people with all of the money who create jobs and give money to the federal government for their budget don’t have anymore money left! ",democrats,1,1531267797.0,comment

2. With a national popular vote, election officials in every state, not just swing states, will have an incentive to, ahem, tweak the vote totals.

Everything else that can possibly be listed is trivial next to this.  Until we can expect the voting stations downtown to be as accessible as the voting stations uptown and until we can expect sane boundaries drawn and until we can expect not to be erased from voter rolls by the GOP (or foreign hackers), none of our other issues matter.

>A straight popular vote is representative of the will of the people while the electoral college is representative of the will of the States.

Is that a problem though? We're the United *States*. Our country is a federation of states. The office of the President was intended to have much less sway over individual states than it now does. Representing us to the world and foreign nations (as with North Korea and the G7 summit and other recent embarrassments), imposing tariffs unilaterally because of boogeyman economics, and going to war on foreign soil with no Congressional declaration or terms of victory (as in the Middle East right now) were never meant to be tools in the President's belt.

Example:


During the last election 50% of Ga votes went to Trump. 45% went to Clinton. Had Ga's votes been divided by the votes, Trump would have gotten 8 of Ga's 16 electoral college votes, and Clinton 7. Instead Trump got all 16 votes instead of dividing them up and equally representing the people's votes.

It keeps more remote regions invested in the federal government and less willing to secede/ignore the federal government or whatever problems may come up.

But we already have Congress to act as representative of the various peoples and regions. The Senate for States as a whole and the House for localities.

I also believe in one man one vote. And that an individual shouldn't have less say in how their government runs than another, which doesn't quite happen under the electoral college. Plus I think making the Presidency a strict popular vote would go a long way towards easing the partisan divide and make candidates less radical and Presidents less tied to their own party in terms of agenda. 

I think the electoral college has been gamed too often and in doing so has divided the parties ideologically and geographically in a way that the US has become practically two different countries within each other. I also think Congressional elections need to be reformed as well, partisan gerrymandering in particular needs to be addressed in order to make our representatives actually representative.

I wouldn't necessarily mind putting some checks on Presidential power. But it often seems like a Congressman's desire for such may hinge on the party the presidency currently belongs to. And with Congressmen often being poor representatives of their own States or butting heads in partisan and party faction disputes that can go on to shut down the government over relatively minor issues I don't often want them in charge of things either.

e24zhj0,">Trickle-down economics, also referred to as trickle-down theory, is an economic theory that advocates reducing taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. It is a form of laissez-faire capitalism in general and more specifically supply-side economics. Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the economic spectrum

Here's a basic definition of trickle down theory, because it appears you either don't understand what trickle down economics are or are intentionally hamfistedly misrepresenting them.

Trickle down is not about ""taking less from people,"" this is a real misrepresentation, it is about eliminating progressive taxes that impact the wealthy, therefore starving public services in favor of larger tax breaks. 

It makes sense to take businesses and the wealthy more than lower-earning individuals. This is the difference between a progressive tax (aimed toward those who can afford it; see property taxes) vs. a regressive tax (aimed toward everyone without discrimination; see sales taxes). Especially considering the extra strain that wealthy people and their businesses put on government funded services (see McDonald's recommending employers sign up for government assistance, or how much wear and tear transportation services cause on our roadways compared to regular cars, see Koch Industries record of environmental pollution that others need to come clean), it makes sense for them to pony up more for the government in order for their contribution to society to be equivalent to what they are taking.

>The less that is taken the more that can he transacted.

Transacted... or, you know, [held in offshore accounts](http://www.businessinsider.com/wealthy-money-offshore-makes-inequality-look-even-worse), at least in part leading to the [worst inequality since the Great Depression](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/).

Teddy Roosevelt put it best:

>There once was a time in history when the limitation of governmental power meant increasing liberty for the people.  In the present day the limitation of governmental power, of governmental action, means the enslavement of the people by the great corporations who can only be held in check through the extension of governmental power.

The eventual turn of socailist from socio-capitalism is the taking of property and goods by force. Henece my reference to 1920 Ukraine. Those Scandinavian countries socialist love to quote have a little problem. Allow me to list...
1. The Nordic system kills inovation and the USA adopting their policies would have a direct impact on the world econoy and invovation. 

2. The low income inequality in Nordic countries was not a cause of their implementation of the welfare state. They had low income inequality, low poverty levels and high economic growth also predated the welfare state. After implementation, you saw a significantly slower growth rate and higher taxes to pay for the welfare state. 

3. Socialism killed small business and startups. Back to point #1. Out of the 50 largest companies in Sweden, only 1 has been post 1970 when the welfare state started to reach far and wide throughout the country.

4. The like of diversity in Nordic countries makes it easier to adopt socialist ideals. Not so easy in the most diverse country in the world.

5. If the government is to take on a bigger and more powerful role in redistributing wealth, citizens first must be willing to put their faith in the government. But in the United States, public trust is historically low 

So with all that being said, introducing any form of socialism into the USA would not only be immoral but self destructive. Destructive in the manner that took place in the Ukraine where farmers crops we're taken without reimbursement and distributed as the government saw fit while the farmers themselves were killed or starved due to the lack of food.

You ensure companies aren’t simply paying the top brass and fucking everyone else. You don’t need to mandate any specific wage cap or wage floor. Struggling businesses have a ton of leeway when starting because founders often don’t get paid a salary at the beginning. ",democrats,8,1512137436.0,comment

dqm6r63,"My response to tax cut on a different thread but too lazy and at work to cater to this thread .


Except corporations are ran by people. If they know they are gonna get tax cuts they move that money from costs of running and therefor increase their stock value. Causing growth in the company and growth within the economy. For example the S&P 500 index increases now. Market trends show unemployment therefore decrease when there is economic growth. Because corps are more willing to hire more.

It’s not so much trickle down economics .

Imagine. If you are trying to buy a tv for $500 and you wanted a ps4 for $200. You only have $500 so you have to decide which do you want more. Well clearly you need a tv to play your ps4 so you have to buy that. but then I told you that on cyber Monday that same tv will cost $300. You as a person would think “great now I have an extra $200.” You would consider that $200 as liquidity. Now you can save it or you can get that ps4.

People tend to think of corporations as entities but forget they are ran by people. It’s really difficult to fully rely on quant analytics of the company to see if you are gunna make a lot of money. Buffet knows that it’s important to have the right people running the company. So you can’t remove the people element. But acting like tax cuts don’t improve the economy you are neglecting that people being told they are gunna save money isn’t going to cause a psychological effect. 

Source look at market trends now and unemployment rate. Look at market trends and employment rates when companies are told that they won’t get that good of a tax cut.

If you need further proof. Companies include big brother fed in there assets because they know if they are too big to fail. The fed will come in and save their asses.

> UPDATE: Democrats just offered an amendment to ensure corporations use their tax savings to raise employee wages at the same rate they increase executive pay, stock buybacks and dividends to shareholders. Every single Republican voting, voted NO. #GOPTaxPlan

""Increas[ing] executive pay, stock buybacks, and dividends to shareholders"" are all ways to line executives' pockets.  Obviously directly increasing their pay does this.  In addition, buybacks and dividends are financial tools to raise the price of company stock, and most executives at large corporations make a significant amount of their compensation in the form of stock options.  This amendment says that if executives want to line their own pockets with tax breaks, they at least have to increase employee compensation at the same rate.  If they want to invest in new equipment, fine.  If they want to pay down debt, fine.  If they want to keep cash on hand for financial reasons, fine.  But they can't simply cut the CEO a huge check without giving their employees a bump, too.  

If Republicans truly believe tax cuts for corporations will lead to higher wages, what's the problem here?  How is this dumb policy?

dqmiqx3,"> dictating the amount of money C.E.O's are allowed to make

That's not what this amendment suggests.

CEOs can raise their pay as high as they want using the money from these tax cuts as long as they raise employee wages, too. 

> Allowing the government to set a maximum wage 

This amendment does no such thing.  

If Republicans really believed in the free market, they'd agree to this amendment on the condition of Democratic support for their tax plan and get the thing passed.  Good CEOs could think of a dozen ways to use tax breaks to create actual grown in their companies, which would in turn raise the value of their stock options.  Bad CEOs -- who just want a bigger paycheck without creating real world value -- wouldn't be able to just funnel the additional money into their pockets.  How much more free market could you get?

""I have enough to live but I want to be paid more"", which is what we're discussing, is not something that we as a society has decided is a market failure that requires intervention, and certainly not something we handle with nonsensical policies like this one.

dqlpn4c,"/u/dschurman says it better, but if a party is gerrymandering state elections, they are also most likely engaged in voter suppression tactics. For example, overly restrictive voter ID laws, reductions in campaign finance regulations, not funding vote monitoring measures, etc.

These efforts are designed to help the vocal minority across all electoral boundaries.

So to answer your question, while gerrymandering state districts shouldn't have a direct effect on a popular vote like a Federal Senator, there are more likely other measures at play being ennacted by the vocal minority that would have a direct effect on a popular vote.

dqln4l2,"Here's a decent answer from my quick google search:

""While the state-wide nature of gerrymandering would make one think that it has no effect, it certainly could.

Elections are run at the state level, so a state-gerrymandered election could alter that balance of power in the state legislature, which would effect things like voter-suppression measures, enactment and enforcement of campaign finance regulations, and the ability of elections to be monitored and for rules to be enforced by non-partisan (or partisan) entities.

In Wisconsin, this was, in part, the basis of their gerrymandering case/challenge that will now be heard by the Supreme Court. In 2012, Democratic candidates got the majority of State Assembly votes, but the GOP won a huge majority in that lawmaking body. The GOP enacted voter ID and other restrictive measures, that have been struck down, then reinstated, by different levels of the courts.

It would be difficult to claim this did not have an impact on state-wide results. Those in power (regardless of party) tend to favor policies and practices that perpetuate their power.""",democrats,18,1512117020.0,comment

dqlp6ed,"**Trickle-down economics**

Trickle-down economics, also referred to as trickle-down theory, is an economic theory that advocates reducing taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. It is a form of laissez-faire capitalism in general and more specifically supply-side economics. Whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall, trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the economic spectrum.

The term trickle-down originated as a joke by humorist Will Rogers and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged, while being framed as good for the average citizen.

There are many countries that don't allow dual citizenship. I was under the mistaken impression that the UK was one of them, as I've never wanted to become a British citizen, I've never need to confirm that.

We have to make decisions about intent and effect, eventually - I don't generally go for ""one size fits all.""

If your old, frail grandfather wears the red hat because - in part - he implicitly thinks it'll keep non-white people in a place of assumed, societal power, I wouldn't call him a Nazi or alt-right supporter, immediately.  I had a grandmother from rural Kentucky who once happily informed me that they called black people ""n*ggers,"" thinking that she was being helpful in that context of an otherwise light conversation - she was implicitly racist from her upbringing, yet didn't harbor hatred or act upon that racism in her daily life, oddly enough - they voted Democratic in the 60s and 70s, too.

So, even if your frail grandfather was unwittingly perpetuating a set of decades-old biases which happen to feed into part of what the alt-right is tapping into that makes them feel emboldened and supported, from the top->down, I still wouldn't see him as the core problem here: he's probably not aware of what implicit bias is, in such a case, and how it can affect others from his perspective.  And, at this point in his life, maybe it doesn't really make much sense to try and help him to see more sides and determine if that really means anything significant to him, frankly - he's may be just trying to live day-to-day at best,I suspect.

And, he may have simply identified with the hoo-rah stuff Trump lied about on the campaign trail and all - dog-whistling or not.  I fail to see any explicit or even implicit attempt to keep other people from having equal rights and opportunities to folks like himself, in that case.

All Trump voters collectively supported a machine which has a horrible, overall emphasis of racial and cultural biases to distract from the power grab by a wealthy demographic minority, but not all Trump voters realized that they were supporting the worst aspects of societal biases in the process, I realize.

Loosely knit movements like BLM work to smack the idea of societal bias directly on the head, in relatively uncompromising fashion: whether you like those tactics or not, they are forcing many people to react and even to think about what's been going on since black people were brought to this area as slaves.  They want people to recognize the operating imbalance of recognition and even in-practice rights that black people still face, on a whole, in the USA today . . . so that something practical could eventually be done about that situation, either through cultural redirections or more formal programs/policies to address the lopsided rights attainments perceived.",democrats,2,1502643989.0,comment

It's easy to sit back now and degrade them, but if you were to be back in their shoes, it's a little more complicated. The moral issues probably killed them, most of them were in debt, and needed their plantations to keep generating an income. There's a point at the end of 1175 where Washington paid some of his troops from his own personal finances, which wouldn't have existed without his plantation, which would have killed our revolution sooner and thusly no America would be born. 
I'm not trying to justify slavery, just the moral dilemma that was faced by our founding fathers at the time. As human rights have progressed, it's easy to be high and mighty, but go back a few hundred years- would it be as easy if you knew the alternative was homelessness and starvation, sickness and death for your family?

I suppose the disconnect is that what some people consider the most horrible of mistakes, other people see as an excellent turn of events.

My awareness of what it is that Russia is believed to have done, or actors within Russia are believed to have done, amounts to some social engineering (on a truly tiny scale, compared to what you see Facebook, Youtube, and Google do with their curated search results and curated stories). 

As to the hacking of the DNC and the like, the House Intelligence report from April? May? covers much of the same information as the most recent Meuller indictments, but additionally points out that efforts were made to hack and retrieve information from Republican computer systems as well.

All that being said, I don't understand the need to become absolutely rabid with regards to Russia, beating the war drums, demanding the most crushing of sanctions. To what end? What does this accomplish?

You are correct. An indictment is not a guilty verdict, (and in truth a guilty verdict does not mean a thing was  actually done, but for the purposes of meaningful conversation we can and should ignore that), however for what it’s worth, with the scrutiny the FBI is under, and the general restraint they’ve shown thus far, I’m inclined to believe they would not release indictments without being very convinced and having a very strong case. That said, I’m not sure yet either, less so because I do not really follow the news as much as I should.

I’ll be honest, I’ve ejected any knowledge of Hillary about my brain and have exactly zero interest in her. She is not the president of the United States. If she’s found to be a criminal, throw her in jail, sure. Hillary is completely besides the point: who would be worse/who’s a worse criminal is a useful conversation during the pathetic mess that is the lead up to voting, and potentially entertaining in retrospect once a new president has been elected, but in the here and now when the president is constantly being perceived to be committing serious crimes, that is the topic at hand, and is the topic that needs pursued. In short, we can’t do anything about Hillary and her crimes, actual or fictional. We can have a conversation to convince others that President Trump is a bad man, and that we should strip him of power how we can, which is to vote both intelligently and against his party, to at least slow down his insanity. Pointing to Hillary and saying “BUT THE EMAILS” is not a defense against accusations leveled at the president, because the president is not Hillary. It’s deflection, plain and simple.

While one can condemn many presidents, not least of which was Obama for committing arguable acts of war against many other countries, that’s a completely different issue. While there is frustration and outrage that the Russians attempted to mess with out elections, that is not people’s issue. Of course Russia would attempt to do that; it’s Russia. Russians don’t give a hoot what other Russians think, much less the rest of the world. What people are up in arms about is the accusations of collusion between Americans, potentially Americans within the Trump Campaign to mess with the campaign. Why his answer is considered a problem is because the FBI is saying that Russia intentionally interferes with the election, and President Trump was asked if he believed in his organizations, and he said “well Hillary is bad, and Putin (a man I will note is widely believed worldwide and within his own country to rig his own elections and just generally do awful things) said he didn’t do it so, *eh* I guess he didn’t do it!” That’s the issue. Siding with Putin against the FBI. Sidestepping the question would have been criticized, but he explicitly showed disregard for the professional allegations from his administrations FBI.

Now I’ll grant that maybe he is some kind of Superman that has some grand plan for the future, and that it really is just him trying to smooth relations with Russia. Russia is a difficult beast to tackle. Russia does whatever it wants, if it thinks it can get away with it, and out and out war isn’t really an option for either side.

2. With no deal in place  Iran can start enriching uranium TOMORROW without limit. And it can limit the most intrusive inspections because there IS no deal.
3. He loosened regulations that concerned consumer protection.  You actually think that's a good idea? Fool.    He also got rid of mostly environmental regulations like those that stopped coal companies from dumping rocks and other debris created by mountain top removal mining into nearby streams.  Prior to that specific regulation the Natural Resources Defense Council discovered that mountain-top removal mining, in which ground is blasted to access coal seams below, has been responsible for the destruction of 2,000 miles of streams in Appalachia.   Fuck clean water I guess.  Companies will always do the right thing when it comes to deciding between profits and our health and environment.  He did these things in 2017.  There is NO WAY they would immediately manifest in  2017's GDP.  He did nothing in 2016... so the success of 2017 is due to policies that were already in place. I'll leave it at that.

8)Travel Ban. Has stopped what?

9)Tax cuts for the 1% which has seen exponential income growth over the past 20 years while the middle class has remained stagnant or worse when factored with the rise in the cost of living.  A tax cut virtually every economics professional says will destroy the economy. Show me one example where supply-side economices based on tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses was successful.  Because Kansas would love to know. They did it and they've been BROKE for years now ($350m deficit in the first fiscal year after the cut then nearly an additional $600m in the next).  They can't even afford A/C in some government buildings.  This was the pure model of trickle-down running, no lefties involved.

I'm a democrat, but I'm fiscally conservative. I think you can have a social conscience and still be reasonable about how much money you throw at social programs. I believe we need to get all these wars under control so some of that money that is going to the military can be used for social programs. I'm called ""unpatriotic"" for that, but I don't think it is. Afghanistan is the younger generation's Viet Nam. It's never going to be over, and if Trump has his way, he will reinstitute the draft.

The point is that this shows the hypocrisy of the GOP.. They aren't complaining at all now.

However, the reason this isn't partisan bullshit on the Democrats part is because of how much *more* the Trumps are costing the taxpayers that the Obama's did.

In his 8 years, it cost the Secret Service an estimated 97 millions dollars for Presidential trips.

They're now on a pace to spend three times that much with this president.

The problem, of course, with your ""rule of interchangability"" is that you kind of gloss over 600 years of subjugation and systemic racism, and a host of other issues that stem from that.

To me, being fiscally conservative means that you want the biggest bang for your buck, and that you only want to help those who really need it, which means putting some money into enforcement. The IRS fraud agents used to actually bring in more money than it cost to run the unit, but somehow, the Republicans thought that was bad so they slashed their budget. That's not being fiscally conservative, that's being fiscally irresponsible. You know why they did it? Because the people they were investigating and forcing to pay were all rich people. They once said that they never looked at people who made normal wages. I think their cutoff was $100,000 a year (which isn't much in today's economy, although I'd take it). They didn't prosecute little people. They just noted their files.

For example, there are so many seniors who don't know they are eligible for food stamps, and wouldn't know how to apply if they did, so they do without when they really need them. A lot of people have no clue how to get into subsidized housing, so they struggle with rent, sometimes not eating so they can have a place to live. There are also rent assistance programs that people don't know about.

Fiscal conservatives want to put money where it will do the most good, not throw it away on bullshit stuff that doesn't move the country forward. We can't move forward if we leave the needy behind. 

One thing that pisses me off SOOOOOO MUCH about the Religious Right is that they claim to be such good Christians, but Christ said we should help the poor, not hurt them, and they don't see that. They've fallen for the Republican rhetoric about ""welfare queens"" and ""food stamp fraud."" But when THEY need help, they think they deserve it, because it's the government's fault they are hard up.

dlz7ft6,"It wasn't some eureka moment, it was gradual. First, I voted (twice) for Reagan. The second time not whole heartedly. He ran on reducing the deficit, but go back and look at what happened. It increased massively. Then there was selling weapons to Iran, so he could bypass Congress. Add to that everyone in the administration forgetting if they said things and I suspected that they really weren't honest people. I voted for Bush the first because I couldn't vote for the liberal Dukakis. No other reasons. I wasn't happy with George Bush but I couldn't vote for someone liberal. The economy did ok, if you were already rich, but not if you weren't. And that great Republican issue, the deficit, was still growing by leaps and bounds. I still voted Bush in 92, for the same reasons I did in 88, but with dwindling enthusiasm. In 96 I voted for Clinton. I can't say that things turned around but they did get better, even for some middle class and poor people. When the Gingrich led the campaign to impeach Clinton, for having sex with an aide (which I believe he is guilty of and I had flashbacks to Reagan here) and it was already common knowledge that Gingrich was a twice divorced man who told his second wife he was divorcing her while she in the hospital for cancer treatments, and marrying someone he had been having an affair with for a while, I couldn't accept his 'family values ' statement with any degree of belief. It turned out that 2 or 3 Republicans were having affairs at the time they were voting to impeach Clinton of the same thing. And when it was eventually pointed out they said it wasn't the same as what Clinton did. 

At the end of his term the loss of income that the middle class had suffered since Reagan had leveled off, though not gone back up, but the deficit was actually going down, and if it stayed on the path it was on might be gone in 10 years. 

Then Jr was elected, the deficit shot back up again,and real middle class ( and poorer) people started doing worse again. With control of the Presidency and Congress there was no real attempt at balancing the budget. 

Until Obama got elected. Then the budget was suddenly important again, as was his religion. Remember, at first, Obama wasn't a Muslim but a disciple of a radical leftist Christian minister. 

And so on. Like I said, it wasn't an epiphany but a lot of compounded hypocrisy.

Lots of things I think that Democrats and others, like Bernie,  are wrong about but I don't see the lying and self serving to the same degree as with Republicans. To the same degree. I'm not saying it isn't there.

And maybe if we drop enough cash on PR, they will instantly have food and electricity?  Maybe enough cash will smother the California fires?  Money alone doesn't solve every problem.  They need more leadership.  Like sending more military aid.  Like helping connect people to resolve these issues quicker.  Maybe the president should do his job and help push for legislation that would do something now, rather than go golfing while congress works out an aid package for insurance claims?

> I do t understand why people ar saying we aren’t do anything.

Because TRUMP is doing nothing.  There is not enough leadership from the federal government to support PR and California.  Maybe Trump should be driving legislation to prevent these problems?  Maybe Trump should be rallying OUR nation together to help our fellow citizens instead of blaming them and attacking people who disagree with him?  Maybe Trump should be doing ANYTHING?

Trump is in fact doing less than nothing.  He is threatening PR in multiple ways.  Does jack shit on his photo op tour of PR.  Hasn't said really anything meaningful on California.  

> And would t you agree that fake news and disrespecting the country is a real problem?

Fake news?  You have 600 posts on the_donald.  That place is a fucking factory of fake news.  You are the problem.  Your sub is the problem.  The person you helped elect to the presidency regularly pushed fake news, gives press credentials to literal fake news, retweets fake news, and is generally the King of fake fucking news.  Don't come here and stand on a platform of ""we need to kill fake news""

And no, disrespecting our country is not a problem that needs to be dealt with now.  And kneeling during the anthem isn't disrespecting our country, since the biggest part of our country isn't some bullshit piece of cotton, it's the fucking goddamn right to protestr this country and make it what you want.  Its so incredibly tone deaf to suggest that the only thing that matters here is when someone chooses to protest in a way that you don't like.  Protesting is the most important AMERICAN right.

> Russian propagandas main goal since the 60s have been to create political divisides in our country

Says the person defending a president who divides this country further at every turn.  The president who didn't know he was the president of PR.  The president who threatened to cut off aid for PR during a crisis.  The president of a party that refused to let PR restructure their debt like any other state.

What bull shit.

> By attacking the fake news media he is trying to bring America back together

WHAT?  You can't honestly be serious...  All of his press secretaries lie pretty much constantly.  He gives time to Breitbart and Infowars.  He retweets lies and conspiracy.  HE FUCKING WENT ON A WITCHHUNT FOR YEARS CLAIMING OUR PRESIDENT WAS A FOREIGN BORN MUSLIM.

dofnehh,"Well, that was just too easy. Wildfires in California? Yeah, every year. Like ten every year. Mostly manageable, but occasionally devastating. I regard it as a State's issue though, being that the State deals with it with such high frequency that they should be experts on the matter. And California is pretty good about wildfires. Still a bit of disconnect between two organizations. One trying to stamp out each and every fire, the other intentionally letting fires burn and saying, ""No, let it burn up all the deadwood and only stop it if it threatens lives. If you stop every wildfire then we'll get a massive one that we can't stop and it will kill people.""

I'll let you guess which school of thought brought about the massive destruction of property seen recently. Okay, no I won't. It's from the people who think every single fire needs to be extinguished instead of nature running its natural course. So instead of putting resources where we need them, when we need them, we have them fighting an un-fightable fire that they themselves built. Pretty fucking unreal that we could have two competing schools of thought on a matter that had about a century of experience on. One being right and the other being catastrophically wrong. But hey, it sort of mimics our political system. One side saying ""We can do something so we should do something!"" The other saying, ""No. don't do shit. It has worked for basically the entirety of human history.""",democrats,8,1508139127.0,comment

There is literally DECADES of data showing areas of high risk to disasters. How do you think the insurance business exists? You can plan for natural disasters and be proactive about it.

At this point, anyone who voluntarily lives in a hurricane prone area, under sea level, etc., is basically just pissing into the wind when it comes time to ask for help. 

So, FALSE. Everyone should plan for the future. And no one is oblivious to the natural phenomena in the area they live.

Intentionally stifling operations in this sense is not something to brag about, it's just another symptom of the opposition Congress saying ""No"" to everything (and willing to shut down the government to get their way).

We shouldn't pretend that Bill was some kind of economic genius, or that Obama somehow navigated the economy with incredible expertise. Bill caused the crash and Bush signed a large amount of the paperwork that helped fix it. Obama's follow-ups mostly applied basic keynesian economics.

Actually Obama should be _blamed_ for that because the economy needed more stimulus than was actually implemented, and the amount he proposed, $750 billion, was based on the initial GDP numbers for the end of 2008, not the actual numbers, which showed that the economy had shrunk almost twice as fast as initially thought.  In other words the stimulus should have been $1.5 trillion. That's not to say the Republican Congress can be excused because they fought against good ideas like infrastructure spending (could have been so cheap when unemployment was at 10%) and Obama's jobs program.  
 
Most people don't realize how bad the economy was when Clinton came to office, but the nation's largest bank, CitiCorp, was only a few days from being declared insolvent, and it looked like the national debt was out of control, thanks to Reagan's voodoo supply-side economics.  Clinton essentially reversed Reagan's economic policies, not only by implementing austerity but also by raising taxes, which Republicans predicted would cause economic armageddon, and no Republicans voted for it (but years later they took credit).  If anything, Clinton's economic policies were like Republican Eisenhower's (the last Republican to run a budget surplus), and  not only there was a budget surplus in each year of Clinton's second term, but there were predictions that the national debt would be completely paid off in the 2030s, later moved up to 2015 in his last year in office.  Actually that wasn't miraculous or radical but just the norm under normal economic policies.  In peacetime, the federal government normally tends toward surpluses and needs occasional tax cuts to prevent excessive surpluses, and it takes true incompetence to cause a deficit problem.

Deficit is the amount by which the debt is increasing annually. When Bush took office, we actually had a surplus, meaning the debt was decreasing. When Bush left office, we had a massive deficit, meaning the debt was increasing by a huge amount every year.

>1980s and 1990s bank product developmentsEdit

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as Congress considered whether to “repeal” Glass–Steagall, commercial banks and their affiliates engaged in activities that commentators later linked to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[114]

Securitization, CDOs, and “subprime” creditEdit

In 1978 Bank of America issued the first residential mortgage-backed security that securitized residential mortgages not guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (“private label RMBS”).[20] Also in 1978, the OCC approved a national bank, such as Bank of America, issuing pass-through certificates representing interests in residential mortgages and distributing such mortgage-backed securities to investors in a private placement.[37] In 1987 the OCC ruled that Security Pacific Bank could “sell” assets through “securitizations” that transferred “cash flows” from those assets to investors and also distribute in a registered public offering the residential mortgage-backed securities issued in the securitization.[115]This permitted commercial banks to acquire assets for “sale” through securitizations under what later became termed the “originate to distribute” model of banking.[116]

The OCC ruled that a national bank’s power to sell its assets meant a national bank could sell a pool of assets in a securitization, and even distribute the securities that represented the sale, as part of the “business of banking.”[117] This meant national banks could underwrite and distribute securities representing such sales, even though Glass–Steagall would generally prohibit a national bank underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities (i.e., non-“bank-eligible” securities).[118] The federal courts upheld the OCC’s approval of Security Pacific’s securitization activities, with the Supreme Court refusing in 1990 to review a 1989 Second Circuit decision sustaining the OCC’s action. In arguing that the GLBA’s “repeal” of Glass–Steagall played no role in the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Melanie Fein notes courts had confirmed by 1990 the power of banks to securitize their assets under Glass–Steagall.[119]

The Second Circuit stated banks had been securitizing their assets for “ten years” before the OCC’s 1987 approval of Security Pacific’s securitization.[120] As noted above, the OCC had approved such activity in 1978.[37] Jan Kregel argues that the OCC’s interpretation of the “incidental powers” of national banks “ultimately eviscerated Glass–Steagall.”[82]

Continental Illinois Bank is often credited with issuing the first collateralized debt obligation(CDO) when, in 1987, it issued securities representing interests in a pool of “leveraged loans.”[121]

By the late 1980s Citibank had become a major provider of “subprime” mortgages and credit cards.[122] Arthur Wilmarth argued that the ability to securitize such credits encouraged banks to extend more “subprime” credit.[123] Wilmarth reported that during the 1990s credit card loans increased at a faster pace for lower-income households than higher-income households and that subprime mortgage loan volume quadrupled from 1993–99, before the GLBA became effective in 2000.[124] In 1995 Wilmarth noted that commercial bank mortgage lenders differed from nonbank lenders in retaining “a significant portion of their mortgage loans” rather than securitizing the entire exposure.[125] Wilmarth also shared the bank regulator concern that commercial banks sold their “best assets” in securitizations and retained their riskiest assets.[126]

ABCP conduits and SIVsEdit

In the early 1980s commercial banks established asset backed commercial paper conduits (ABCP conduits) to finance corporate customer receivables. The ABCP conduit purchased receivables from the bank customer and issued asset-backed commercial paper to finance that purchase. The bank “advising” the ABCP conduit provided loan commitments and “credit enhancements” that supported repayment of the commercial paper. Because the ABCP conduit was owned by a third party unrelated to the bank, it was not an affiliate of the bank.[127] Through ABCP conduits banks could earn “fee income” and meet “customers’ needs for credit” without “the need to maintain the amount of capital that would be required if loans were extended directly” to those customers.[128]

By the late 1980s Citibank had established ABCP conduits to buy securities. Such conduits became known as structured investment vehicles (SIVs).[129] The SIV’s “arbitrage” opportunity was to earn the difference between the interest earned on the securities it purchased and the interest it paid on the ABCP and other securities it issued to fund those purchases.[

Are we saying that they had one year during their presidency which the deficit was lower than the previous year? If that were the case, then we have to include GW Bush Jr in this list.

So then are we saying that the final year deficit of these presidents was less than the final year deficit of their previous president? If that's the case, then this picture works out.

But doesn't using just the final year metric seem a bit arbitrary?

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub.L. 111–5), nicknamed the Recovery Act, was a stimulus package enacted by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2009. Developed in response to the Great Recession, the ARRA's primary objective was to save existing jobs and create new ones as soon as possible. Other objectives were to provide temporary relief programs for those most affected by the recession and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy.

The approximate cost of the economic stimulus package was estimated to be $787 billion at the time of passage, later revised to $831 billion between 2009 and 2019.

I'm not sure why you think only the first and last years matter, can't you see how that could easily be manipulated? If I had $1 trillion in deficit for 7 years of my presidency, but then the last year, I passed a budget that was only $3.50 deficit, then my last year isn't *really* a good picture of my presidency. I think the numbers given in my source could be improved by tying them to the inflation rate.

I get what you are saying, that it might take time to fuck up a balanced budget, and it takes time to correct a bad budget, but I don't agree that looking at only the last year is a fair measure.... maybe a weighted measure would be fair, like their first year is only counted at 25% weight, and the full weight of their budget doesn't count until year 4. 

Finally, since you wanted to address Obama's case specifically, the imbalanced budget of Bush's last year and Obama's first year were heavily impacted by TARP and the Economic Stimulus Act, both of which Obama not only voted in favor of, but defended multiple times, citing that with TARP the banks paid back all of what was lended to them when Romney tried to use it against him in the 2012 campaign.... and Obama was right, to this day few Republicans seem to realize that Obama's lending actually generated income for the U.S. because our treasury made interest on the money that we lent out from those polices.

Deficits don't change overnight.  They have to be gradually lowered.  For a drastic change in deficit, you'd have to spike people's taxes or gut systems that already exist and are being utilized.  Neither are good.

That means the second, and probably even third year to some extent are part of the long tail impacts of the president before them.  


> If I had $1 trillion in deficit for 7 years of my presidency, but then the last year, I passed a budget that was only $3.50 deficit, then my last year isn't really a good picture of my presidency.

Is that what happened?  Because if it is, you'd have a valid argument.  There are always caveats and exceptions.  If you'd like to bring up a valid caveat, by all means, do it.  


>but I don't agree that looking at only the last year is a fair measure.... maybe a weighted measure would be fair, like their first year is only counted at 25% weight, and the full weight of their budget doesn't count until year 4.

While I don't disagree with this, there are literally hundreds of ways you can gauge something a president has done, and this would certainly be a valid metric to look at, the original discussion was whether Obama lowered the deficit or not.   It was lower when he left office than when he came in, so the claim is true, even if you don't even think it's a useful metric. 

Really, though, the claim is lacking context.  Yes, he lowered the deficit, but to know whether it's an important fact to bring up, you'd want to know *why* you're pointing out that he lowered the deficit.  I think this is geared towards people who claim that Democrats only increase spending and Republicans lower it.  It's a basic rebuttal to a basic accusation.",democrats,1,1515608631.0,comment

As you know and are too honest to deny, the president's fiscal year normally doesn't start until October, meaning from  Jan -Sept of 2017 we were operating under the Obama budget.  One exception to the October start was in Obama's first term, when his $750B stimulus program was passed early in 2008.  
 
Republicans can run a successful economy.  Eisenhower did it in the 1950s, but the economy grew slowly, perhaps because of a breather from the hectic pace of WWII or his austerity.  And under Reagan the economy grew faster than it has under any post-WWII Republican president, very slightly better than under Democrat Jimmy and worse than under Democrats Kennedy, Johnson, and Clinton.  So the best Republican did about as well as the average Democrat.  Also Reagan's economy did better in his 2nd term, when he raised taxes every year, unlike only 3-4 years as during his 1st term.  

One problem with Republican presidents has their recklessness -- voodoo supply side tax cuts under Reagan and George W. Bush, wage-price controls under Nixon.  I'm surprised so few people bring up those price controls because they were truly radical and probably did more harm than people realize.  Former Fed chairman Paul Volcker said they made inflation worse and that it took 10 years to fix the problem; he should know because he's the one who fixed it, by slamming down on the money supply and driving the US into the biggest postwar recession, until the Great Recession, only Volcker's recession did some good.

> Most middle income people could afford a mortgage.

Most middle class people can afford a mortgage up to $300,000. However the areas that had real estate bubbles were seeing home prices of $400k, $600k, $700k etc. and 9% - 12% annual price increases or more, and people willing bought those mortgages thinking the prices would never drop and interest rates would always remain low. They were also pretty stupid and used their houses as credit cards to finance their spending, or tried to get into real estate speculation or house-flipping. Even if it was unethical for banks to allow this, no one forced consumers to make stupid choices. 

>However it was lack of regulations that allowed banks to do this in the first place, which would have been in place with democratic leadership. 

This is a major over-simplification. Good regulations can make a major difference, but are not some magic-bullet. A good example right now would be Canada, which has had a real estate bubble not unlike ours since 2015, despite having a strictly regulated banking system that allowed them to avoid a meltdown in 2008. Economic trends and mentality changes can overwhelm even the best regulations.

Outsourcing is one part of the picture and completely ignores all the jobs created by increased exports to Canada and Mexico (which have nearly doubled since 2000) and lower inflation.

Sure, but for what it's worth, I think we could spike the taxes of the wealthiest 1%, and spend less on the military to decrease our deficit without much harm economically... Keep in mind, we used to tax the wealthiest people at >90%.

>Is that what happened? Because if it is, you'd have a valid argument.

Yeah, it kind of is, but in reverse. If you look at Bush compared to Obama, Bush only spent more than Obama's **lowest** spending year twice. Bushes last year, where the deficit was at it's highest during his tenure, was about 250% more than his second highest deficit. So the next most important thing is context, ""*Why was Bush's final year so much more expensive?*"" It was expensive because of TARP, which again, is a policy that Obama was in favor of and defended in the 2012 election.

We had special cases in Bush's last year, and Obama's first year... but according to you, it should be fine if we only count years 5, 6, 7 & 8, so let's do that, shall we:

President|Year|Deficit (billions)|Total
:--|:--:|--:|--
Bush Jr.|FY 2006|248|248
Bush Jr.|FY 2007|161|409
Bush Jr.|FY 2008|459|868
**Bush Jr.**|FY 2009|1,160|**$2,028**

President|Year|Deficit (billions)|Total
:--|:--:|--:|--
Obama|FY 2014|485|485
Obama|FY 2015|438|923
Obama|FY 2016|585|1,508
**Obama**|FY 2017|666|**$2,174**

So you see, even when we put the massive stimulus package under Bush, we still see that Bush's 4 year total was less than Obama's 4 year total. Back to my argument about how the last year of a presidents term might be an outlier in terms of spending, I think it applies for both Bush's last year, and Obama's first year.

>I think this is geared towards people who claim that Democrats only increase spending and Republicans lower it.

I think you're right... I think it's important to remind people that Trump is increasing spending, and decreasing tax revenue... we're in for a hell of a deficit next year, and I feel terrible for our next generations. I think lowering tax revenue, especially for the wealthiest people, has been shown to consistently lead to higher deficits.

Here's a column they published in 2012:  [""Want a Better Economy?  History Says Vote Democrat""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2012/10/10/want-a-better-economy-history-says-vote-democrat/#76ad1cf6cb44).  
 
Similar articles have appeared in the Wall Street Journal (at least during the pre-Rupert Murdoch Bancroft family ownership days) and Barron's (was once a cover story), neither fans of Democrats.  Why do you think that is?  The closest I could find to a semi-credible excuse was from a book by former Fed vice-chairman Alan Blinder, a Democrat:  bad timing for Republicans.

dshusyx,"> CRA most certainly contributed to the housing bubble because it forced banks to meet racial quotas for mortgages given irregardless of financial security.

this is completely, utterly false. The CRA had absolutely no racial quotas. Only 6% of subprime mortgages were issued under the CRA. 

You are conflating two completely separate things: responsible lending towards low-income people (the CRA), and reckless lending by banks that was backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

In the 15 largest metropolitan areas that were hit hardest by the housing crash, 84% of subprime mortgages were issued by banks and other financial institutions that were NOT governed by the CRA. 

The CRA has had overwhelmingly positive effects on poor communities. It has nothing to do with the 2008 crash.

> Also, I think your giving way too much of the blame to middle income people. I agree that middle income people were part of the problem but low income people were also receiving mortgages they couldn't afford.

Again, completely wrong. Subprime does not equal ""poor people getting loans"". You can be middle class, upper-middle class, or even rich, but if you don't handle your money properly (like not paying your credit card bill or mortgage on time for whatever reason), you will be issued a subprime loan. Over 35% of subprimes were issued to investors and speculators who wanted to sit on the property until the prices went up and rent it out in the meantime. Poor people can't take out second mortgages!! Subprime loans were overwhelmingly issued to middle- and upper-middle income people, not the poor. ",democrats,1,1515630820.0,comment

Now am I allowed to introduce other economic indicators that prove the economy under Trump is soaring?


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/politics/wp/2018/01/05/trumps-first-year-jobs-numbers-were-very-very-good/

So yes, slower job growth. And a much, much stronger economy. Not to mention lower unemployment rates than predecessors. And a 17 year low for black unemployment.

The larger picture of the economy is more important to me than just one indicator, especially when that indicator fails to consider unemployment being lower than that experienced during Obama’s time in office. If job growth is all you care about, Obama is your guy.

dsghour,"Soaring needs to be ""qualified"" as growth looks good for 2017, but 4th quarter frequently has a dip due to exports slowing.

Those economic indicators all fall in line with trends of the last few years under Obama, I will remind you that tremendous tax cuts are often followed by recessions, and Trump himself saw our current growth as a ""bubble""

“We’re in a bubble,” added Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. “And, frankly, if there’s going to be a bubble popping, I hope they pop before I become president because I don’t want to inherit all this stuff. I’d rather it be the day before rather than the day after, I will tell you that.”

This being the case I would be cautious of too much praise prior to seeing if his vaunted leadership and foresight are accurate.
If it is a bubble, his tax cuts may predicate and exacerbate the upcoming collapse he extolled early in 2016. ",democrats,1,1515566499.0,comment

So he doesn't vote. For a while there, I found that somewhat admirable. He is uncompromising in his principles and that is respectable. 

But then Representative Keith Ellison (D-MN) said: ""Not voting is not a protest. It's a surrender. ""  

I found that line really remarkable. Don't surrender. Don't quit. Push forward, always.

e2f5b2q,"In Australia voting is compulsory. Sorry, to be more accurate - showing up at a polling booth is compulsory. Once they've ticked your name off you can walk out, or write ""fuck all of you"" on your ballot and put it in the box. But you have to show up.

What that means is that for the political parties, discouraging voters just isn't an option. Not having polls adequately staffed isn't an option. Having any voter wait for hours to vote isn't an option, because that person _has_ to get to the polling booth, and imagine how pissed off they're going to be when they get there?

You might think ""well that just means more dumb people will vote"" but a) fuck you, you just want people to vote for your party and those people are entitled to a voice b) when everyone has to vote the parties _need_ to try and reach out to and educate those voters vs just disenfranchising them and c) just think for one second about whose interests are best served by you believing that, and whether or not you've internalised a lie that they sold you.

You are absolutely right.

Two flawed candidates, Hillary, at best was a centrist that would have maintained the status quo of lower middle and lower class American disenchantment, and Trump the bullshit artist of the century. Trump promised the moon and gave you a shit sandwich.

This is the choice we were given. I'm not surprised how it panned out.

The Democratic response to the fact that health care costs are spiraling out of control and actually killing people who can't afford insurance is...to force people to buy insurance? What in the blue fuck is that? It's literally something these supposedly villainous Republicans would propose - *and have.*

2, their platform isn't honestly that important to them. They would rather prattle on about Russia this and Russia that than actually face the fact that they are partially to blame for the dire conditions of working people, and actually talk about policy to address it.

e2eofqe,"**Duverger's law**

In political science, Duverger's law holds that plurality-rule elections (such as first past the post) structured within single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system, whereas ""the double ballot majority system and proportional representation tend to favor multipartism"". The discovery of this tendency is attributed to Maurice Duverger, a French sociologist who observed the effect and recorded it in several papers published in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of further research, other political scientists began calling the effect a ""law"" or principle.

Duverger's law draws from a model of causality from electoral system to a party system.

e2ey3gw,"**Duverger's law**

In political science, Duverger's law holds that plurality-rule elections (such as first past the post) structured within single-member districts tend to favor a two-party system, whereas ""the double ballot majority system and proportional representation tend to favor multipartism"". The discovery of this tendency is attributed to Maurice Duverger, a French sociologist who observed the effect and recorded it in several papers published in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of further research, other political scientists began calling the effect a ""law"" or principle.

Duverger's law draws from a model of causality from electoral system to a party system.

The one aspect that pisses me off more than any other, is that many self-proclaimed progressives have never bothered to vote in mid-terms, off-years, special elections or primaries, sending a silent/indifferent yet clear signal to the DNC that it needed to shift to the center to woo soft moderates, then these apathetic progressives threw a tantrum in 2016 because ""the party doesn't look the way I want it to look"".  Boo fucking hoo.

Plenty of real progressives have run for office, could have been part of a much larger progressive coalition within the Democratic Party, but have been met by crickets in the stands come election day, their political careers fizzled before they even started, while some hippies I know bitch and whine about ""the political system being corrupt"" while they smoke their pot, drink their beer and never even notice there's a local or state election going on that very same day.

I mean, having a functional large family and living a middle-class suburban lifestyle and knowing I can afford to go to college with the help of my parents are all privileges that I know I'm very lucky to have, and I'm glad the law benefits people who aren't in such cozy financial circumstances.

dfdbcl9,"Obama's race made an unknown but non-zero percentage of Republicans more hostile to his proposals.

However, I don't think we have to get into race to explain what happened.

The ACA was a messy compromise with provisions that predictably angered many voters.

For example, race wasn't the reason why some voters got mad about the tax penalty for not having heath insurance for at least one month out of the year.  Anyone who found themself paying hundreds of dollars for *not* having health coverage would be pissed; they would feel like they were paying a tax for being disadvantaged.

Now, there are policy justifications for that tax; I'm just talking about how many voters felt about the situation.

Furthermore, the ACA is a complex law which almost no one fully understands, even if they are highly educated.  After it passed, many voters began to blame Obamacare for premium increases, denied treatments, etc., even if they had no evidence that Obamacare caused those problems.  It became a scapegoat for everything people disliked about for-profit healthcare and healthcare insurance.

The Republicans contributed to those perceptions and took advantage of the resulting anger to achieve electoral wins.  They even sabotaged the ACA to an extent by forcing the federal government to renege on the ACA's risk corridor provisions (basically, a provision in the ACA which said that the gov't would reimburse insurance companies for a certain percentage of transition costs incurred during the ACA's first few years due to the ban on discrimination against pre-existing conditions).  When insurance companies didn't get those payments, they began dropping out of the health exchanges.

All that time, the Republicans didn't have a better plan.  They didn't think they would win the presidency in 2016, so they continued to bitch about Obamacare like an opposition party would: All complaints and finger-pointing, no practical fixes.

That's what put them in the position that they're in today, IMO.  They demonized the ACA, but they can't find enough votes in Congress to pass a more right-wing healthcare law or a more left-wing healthcare law.",democrats,12,1490392683.0,comment

If you take away a person's health insurance, and they can't pay for their own, or even get their own due to pre-existing conditions (think cancer), they die. That's how that happens. If you want to know how many people will die, the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/23/repealing-the-affordable-care-act-will-kill-more-than-43000-people-annually/) suggests around 43,000 annually. 172,000 at the end of his term, or ~0.05% of the U.S. population (318.9 mil).

>But that doesn't matter, this isn't a federal issue. It shouldn't be regulated by the federal government.


Piss off. We're a world power. We're a developed first world nation. We have one of the strongest economies in the world. We are at a point where we can easily keep these people alive. Funneling that tax money into almost anything else is a disgusting misuse. Keeping people alive is more directly beneficial to the people of the U.S. than building a new, more expensive border wall. I'm not saying Obamacare is the best, or even a good, plan. But it's not like Trumpcare was going to fix it, and ""nothing"" isn't an option. Nobody wants to live in a shithole country where your only options if you can't afford to see a doctor are crippling debt (which isn't even an option if you need continued treatments) or just dying. 

And the constitution was made to be amended - this is clearly a point where the federal government needs to step in. The american healthcare system is and has been godawful. Obamacare is hardly a step towards fixing it, but it needs to be fixed at a federal level. Single payer healthcare is the only reasonable option. There should not be an open market for healthcare.

[Southern Strategy during the Obama era](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021934709352979)

[Colin Powell: GOP has 'a dark vein of intolerance'](http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2013/01/powell-gop-has-a-dark-vein-of-intolerance-154019) - Powell is a Republican, so his assessment carries extra weight.  He has worked among Republican leaders and knows them well.

Now, it is always hard to know what someone else is thinking; we can't see inside their heads.  Only in rare cases do we have explicit admissions of racism from public figures.

There are also alternative motives in most cases, usually political ones.  For example, what role does racism play in GOP voter suppression efforts against blacks?  One could choose to believe that those efforts are solely motivated by politics, because blacks overwhelmingly vote Democratic.

In the end, it is a matter of how charitable you are willing to be when assessing the motives of a political party with a long history of catering to white supremacism, usually via dog-whistles, to get votes.  

Personally, I think Democrats sometimes go too far and attribute too many Republican actions (both from voters and politicians) to racism, while many whites and Republicans go to the opposite extreme and demand an ironclad case for racist motivations before they will even entertain the idea.

She's spent her whole adult life fighting oppressive shit. Going undercover to bust schools for being segregationist, fighting for education for handicapped children. The first time she tried to tackle healthcare as first lady. Changing the rules at the state department to stop discriminating against transgender people on their passports.

The parties, knowing they are essentially untouchable because forming an opposition party is ultimately counterproductive because you will be lifting votes from the party you theoretically find less reprehensible, have both turned into bloated, lazy parodies of ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" that both serve private interests before the people. Neither party wants to eliminate fptp voting, because it all but guarantees their continued relevance. It's why we see the dnc fighting so hard to push back against progressives entering the party as well, because they've made it clear they'd only be using the party to help dismantle the system the party has been complicit in creating and maintaining. As it is, even if the GOP imploded, another ""conservative"" umbrella party would materialize in opposition to the dems. Maybe even with new faces, but you could be sure the people in the background we don't see wouldn't change. But a democrat-run single party state wouldn't happen. We're stuck in this useless binary until the American people demand change and actually show up to run and vote in primaries before it elections get pared down to rubber-stamped, party-friendly candidates we get to ""choose"" between.

It's not that uncommon for the definitions of parties to align around different issues. There was a time when Democrats were racist bigots and KKK members. There was a time when Republicans started the Department of Education, Environmental Protection Agency and national highway system. There was a time when Democrats were the anti-privacy, national-security champions and when Republicans were the peaceful vote. Any massive defeat or damage of the Republican party might be helpful in that it allows us to redraw the line between the parties again.

Libertarians could take Republicans' place which would make the debate more about the means (fiscal policy, what is done by government) since they agree in many ways on the social goals (e.g. marry who you want, smoke what you want, define your gender how you want, define your family how you want, have sex how you want, etc.). I think that would be the cleanest replacement because it'd allow Democrats to stand for the same sort of platform but would still be a thing enough people would rally around to form a viable alternative party.

dhq2c1p,"The electoral college is problematic, but it's still democracy. It's a democratic republic. Democracy in the sense of each person has an equal say in all issues is virtually impossible to implement. So, very immediately, the issue becomes how far removed (via representatives) is the democracy and what should the value of a person's vote correlate to. Neither of these has obvious or definite answers.

Given that we have states governments with higher autonomy and more governmental responsibility compared to other countries, at the founding we came up with the bicameral legislature as a compromise that ensured that small state issues weren't essentially ignored by the congress which would be dominated by states with more people. In present day, 63% of the population lives in the 3.5% of the land area that we deem cities. There are multiple rational responses to how that should impact voting. In one sense, maybe a popular vote is good because it represents the most people directly. However, in another sense, maybe the popular vote is bad because we might consider each voter as a representative of their circumstances and in that case the ""majority"" represented only 3.5% of the land area which might translate into their capacity to appreciate environmental issues, agricultural needs, realities of the borders, etc. Additionally, the electoral college forces, in theory, some sense of widespread support. Because of the electoral college, it's really hard to win the election by having really strong regional support. Winning twice as strongly in New England doesn't prevent you from needing to appeal to states across the country. That ties into what I mentioned above, but it also discourages polarizing candidates and encourages candidates who can get some appeal in each of the many different cultures/geographies of the county, therefore, encourages candidates who appeal to the fuller set of issues in the country. That is a good quality for national leaders.

At the (inter?) national level, you have the trade deals. You often see r/futurology talking about the Ball State University study where 900,000/6,000,000 manufacturing jobs were lost to trade, but MIT in contrast puts it at 2,400,000 jobs lost due to the Chinese alone, not even counting NAFTA. These are good paying jobs lost, and households that flip red.

At the state and local level, corporate income tax. My state Connecticut used to have lots of industry and corporations (insurance, hedge funds etc.) but this all went away when the Democratic governor levied a corporate tax. My father, a printer, was laid off when RR Donnelly consolidated into indiana, which has no such tax. It's the same at a larger level. So when you see that detroit has its own corporate income tax its easy to see why no sane business would open there.

Minimum wage raises in fact act as consumption taxes, as higher wages become consumer burdens. With 67% of the impoverished out of work and 25% underemployed, what minimum wage hikes end up doing is increasing unemployment, redistributing wealth to the middle/upper-class kids working part time at the cost of a cost of living hike the poor. Past experience shows minimum wage hikes redistribute the wealth across all classes but disproportionately hurt the impoverished, who are without work.

Illegal immigration again benefits the employers, with the cost of living decrease due to illegally low wages helping the impoverished and rich. HOWEVER, this artificially deflates wages, hurting the working class.  This is why totally ignoring the border was a bad idea for Hillary. Amnesty didn't work at all, so people took what they saw as a (even if it was dubious) solution rather than no solution. Ignoring or failing to address key policy issues has really hurt Democrat credibility.

More socially conservative people will argue stop and frisk really does reduce crime ( which it does at a moral cost). Violent crime concentrates in minority (esp black) communities due to the cycle of fatherlessness/poverty. When around half the serious crime is in concentrated areas, this leads to increased police presence, meaning police are far more interfering in these communities. It's just how it works, sadly. Don't like it but it saves lives long term.

Ball State was also the lowest number. Many believe labeling China a normal trade partner in 2000 under Clinton was the biggest problem. January 2016 found [PDF] that competition with China had a much bigger negative impact on U.S. jobs since 2001, when China joined the WTO. Hanson, an economist and trade expert at the University of California, San Diego, says that the steepest decline in manufacturing jobs, which fell from seventeen million to eleven million between 2000 and 2010, is mostly attributable to trade with China and underlying technological changes. “China is at the top of the list in terms of the employment impacts that we found since 2000, with technology second, and NAFTA far less important,” he says. MIT again puts China alone at 2,400,000 jobs killed.

CBO states moving up Fed. minimum wage to $10.10 like in my state would kill 500,000 jobs and get 900,000 out of poverty. Which is cool but then you factor in the cost of living hike on the other 39 mil impoverished which would be far more than the benefit to the poor even if you lowball. CBO also states the net benefits of minimum wage hike is between all classes (because of middle class people working part time), but we both know who cost of living increases hurt the most.

Fining the hell out of businesses with illegal wages would be enjoyable.

S&F gone 2013. Murder increased by 10% 2014-2015, predicted to go up again ( Pew). 2016 has also seen the first increase in violent/net crime. Compare this to what was a strong downward trend. I mean you can argue equal protection, but when half of the violent crime is by a certain group (FBI), half the people being of that group being stop and frisked is arguably proportional. You would have to weigh the forth amendment against the danger in that case.

It's pretty accurate. All of our business is gone (even Hartford insurance), and our economic performance is dismal. The businesses really are relocating. There's no other explanation.

I also have gripes with the hi-cap trading taxes Bernie was going to use to pay for college. Bringing up capital gains would be far better, but a hi-cap tax would tank the economy and underperform based on every past example we have. (I'll elaborate when I have time).

For u/crazyalbo

Globalization has benefited the net economy at the cost of the working class. The people who benefit most are the very rich due to MUCH higher profit margins, then the very poor who get a cost of living decrease. The working & middle class only see wage deflation and loss of jobs.

What I'm worried about is not income inequality (which rises whenever you lower taxes to promote growth and lowers when you raise taxes to consolidate gains) but wealth inequality. After 08, Pew puts household wealth down ~90% for the lower, ~50% for the middle, and only ~20% for the upper class. The poor are skating on much thinner ice than we're used to. 

I can mount a pretty good defence of reaganomics, which I find leads to benefits to all but increases inequality. Which would be alright if everyone was in a similar boat to start, but the wealth gap as well is not pretty.

Personally I believe much of the problems that the US faces is due to the shift of business/manufacturing towards international centers that have lower costs of production, over-head, and labor. The world is globalizing, which conservatives want to fight so bad but can't because advancement of technology forces globalization no matter what they want save for the strategy of isolationism. 

So, since the world is becoming a more global market, corps abuse the lower costs they have in countries such as China with low regulations and a currency system that is so transparent that it's a sheet of black tape. 

My opinion is in order to create a more balanced global economy there needs to be a global oversight board that maintains fairness in the many avenues of cost-cutting and capital funding. Right now jobs go to the east because it's cheap there but as these countries evolve into the first world countries they are the globe will need to maintain the spread of jobs throughout the world by factoring comparative advantage at a policy level. I.E. forcing countries who produce a certain product to do so because they can benefit from the jobs this makes available. Countries that don't have a comparative advantage in production would be forced to focus on providence of services. 

How do you feel globalization is affecting our economies/global economy?

As a Libertarian (i.e. embarrassed by how socially conservative democrats are and how fiscally liberal Republicans are), I understand presenting this as an issue since the debates are often framed around platforms that create a false choice (e.g. if you believe in gay rights you must also agree with forced union membership, if you believe in gun rights you must be pro-life on abortions). However, in all fairness, the two party system is only as bad as its capacity to prevent people from entering and changing those parties. The performance of Trump and Sanders who were both party outsiders has shown that the two party system is not that bad in that regard. Both of them (even the one that lost the primary) caused important shifts in the party platform. Can we do better? Yes. Are we ""fucked""? I don't think so.

>  with both sides driven into serving corporate interest

The tricky truth is that, regardless of donations and campaign finance, powerful individuals and corporations have a disproportionate voice and a disproportionate capacity to factor into decision making. Campaign finance is a nice scapegoat for a problem that is almost impossible to fix and will still exist even if donations are banned entirely. At the same time, because of the reason I just said, I'm incredibly skeptical of any country claiming that they got around this. Overcoming corporate interest (or more appropriately, the influence of the few and powerful) involves severely disrupting the capacity for the free press (corporations' ability to communicate), for free speech (celebrities of business, politics or elsewhere able to direct attention cheaply), etc. Money is just one way among many that candidates who have the approval of the powerful are advantaged.

> in the hard right wing of the spectrum

This is largely because of, not in spite of, the fact that we are a democracy and that democracy is working. Areas where we are at the right are generally there because substantial amounts of the country believe that stance. It turns out that being against prostitution is really common so we don't really debate it. It turns out that being against federal-level universal healthcare is pretty contested which is why there is a lot of deadlock and difficulty when one side tries to do something there either way. It turns out that being in favor of a softer stance on drugs is becoming popular which is why both parties have been softening their stance on that in congress and has tied the government's capacity to act on some of the laws that do exist. So, the fact that it's to the right isn't a poor reflection on the system. It's a reflection of the balance of American culture itself.

That being said, it's hard to immediately equivocate that with being fucked. Aside from where people settle on that spectrum being pretty arbitrary in its objective basis, left-right is an oversimplified view of politics as is the notion you seem to be implying that there is a clear bad-good spectrum where since we're to the right of Europe coming around to Europe-like solutions is improvement for us. As I said, I'm a Libertarian, so I disagree with many of the areas where we are to the right (e.g. drugs, prostitution, family planning, marriage, gay rights, transgender rights, immigration, treatment of muslims, etc.), but at the same time, I don't see Europe as the only or the best way forward. I think they diverged down a path that (in a region/population as large and varied as the US especially) would only slow social progress. That ends up being another issue in the US compared to European countries. Many supposed conservatives are really just people who believe in the tradition of deferring to the states. That's because trying to solve issues in a way that Texas and California will both be satisfied is challenging so it creates deadlock or resentment. In that sense, liberal people may still vote not to do things at the federal level, making the more appropriate metaphor that the states correspond to European countries. In that sense, a lot of the states are indeed quite more to the left than the US as a whole.

> Nobody has any appetite or power to reform the two things that will change this (party funding and electoral reform).

For one thing, we've come a long way. Initially, the president was voted for by state congressmen who were voted for by white men. Over time, not only did we expand who is allowed to vote, but we managed to change the system multiple times ultimately to being based off of the popular vote in that state. Even now, that's not firmly held. Maine and Nebraska distribute their electors based on the popular vote and Virginia proposed a similar plan. That is alongside [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact) which is a persistent effort to shift to a popular vote. Other things like ranked voting have been implemented in some states as well. The curse of the Electoral College is also its strength: states have a lot of freedom to choose how they allocate their electors. As a result, there is a pretty continuous, but gradual evolution in how our elections work. Our system has never really stopped evolving toward an all inclusive popular vote and while it's not happening overnight I don't think it makes sense to say it's not happening or can't happen.

As for campaign finance, at the federal level we do have government-funded campaign finance which isn't perfect but was utilized by the Reform party. We also have ways at the state level to save or raise money. I don't recall the exact number, but the performance of the Libertarian party in the 2016 election ends up saving them many millions of dollars for the next election. Some states, like CT, have their own programs for financing campaigns through government. At the same time, Democrats generally claim to support campaign finance reform at the national level, with Clinton and Sanders bring it up a lot. So there are existing and proposed steps forward here as well. Also, the candidates that raised the most money in the primaries (Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders) didn't win. Money isn't everything and the use of that money is a focus of reform as well.

My point isn't that this is all perfect. It's that we're not ""fucked"" as there is a pretty viable path forward that we've been working toward and that many of these issues exist in other forms in government who claim to have solved them. It's simply not an easy thing to solve.",democrats,2,1495128281.0,comment

From https://www.imf.org/EXTERNAL/PUBS/FT/ISSUES11/INDEX.HTM (edit fixed link)

""In the United States, for example, wages of less-skilled workers have fallen steeply since the late 1970s relative to those of the more skilled. Between 1979 and 1988 the average wage of a college graduate relative to the average wage of a high school graduate rose by 20 percent and the average weekly earnings of males in their forties to average weekly earnings of males in their twenties rose by 25 percent. This growing inequality reverses a trend of previous decades (by some estimates going back as far as the 1910s) toward greater income equality between the more skilled and the less skilled. At the same time, the average real wage in the United States (that is, the average wage adjusted for inflation) has grown only slowly since the early 1970s and the real wage for unskilled workers has actually fallen. It has been estimated that male high school dropouts have suffered a 20 percent decline in real wages since the early 1970s.""

Also, even if we lived in a fantasyland where this were possible (to do in an extremely short amount of time no less) there wouldn’t be time to hold a special election before the appointment and so the Senate would STILL be majority Republican.

Identifying two Republican Senators to bribe is ridiculous and the chances of it working are near zero. Setting aside the fact that the Senators would reject a straight-up bribe because they would expect they were being trapped, appointing a SCOTUS Justice is one of their most prized roles. Rejecting a Republican nominee is anathema to everything they stand for. There’s no bribe big enough. If you think there is, go ahead and offer it. Watch what happens.

If the Republican Party wants to break all the rules, than either we need to find a way to hold them accountable, or change the rules. But playing a game where both sides don’t abide by the rules, is not how we should be governing. 

It’s a pathway to more corruption. I’m not making a slippery slope argument, it’s just the state of humanity and this country. We can’t keep lowering the bar, we already can barely look in the mirror. 

So yes, we HAVE to stop Trump putting an insane person on the bench.

It has been the longstanding position at the DOJ that a sitting President can’t be indicted and Mueller’s office has indicated that they are operating under that norm. Therefore I think it’s extremely unlikely that Trump will be indicted as President. It is certainly possible that he’s indicted when he becomes a private citizen again.

I do think it’s telling that instead of addressing whether the President will be indicted as President, you resorted to baseless name calling and listed off a bunch of other people who have been indicted. Probably because you know you’re wrong.",democrats,24,1530219759.0,comment

There lies the problem with the media today IMO. It brings ratings, yes, but it pollutes the truth. 

You can ask someone if the sky is blue, and they will go on a tangent about some random topic to draw a false equivalency, and never actually answer the question. There is only so much time for the segment, so they can just continuously not answer questions and get their talking points out. Whats worse is that these are the same people who are trying to de-legitimize sources, and news as a whole. If someone has their back up against the wall, and has no logical defense, the best strategy is to de-legitimize the sources of this...and unfortunately it's a solid strategy. By deligitimizing sources of truth, you get a two-fer. If these sources have dirt on you, you can just say ""see i told you, they are just full of lies"" and then when they rightfully call out your lies, you can just say ""I've been telling you this forever, you can't trust them"" bringing further 'legitimacy' to you in your supporters eyes. Now, your supporters who listen to this are defacto surrogates, defending you on the ground when normal everyday people are challenging you. Your supporters blindly support you in the face of criticism, because in their eyes, you are the only source of the truth.

I'm very upset that both sides of the aisle stood up and applauded at Obama's last state of the union when he gloated that we spend more than the next 10 countries combined on military. I'm not all that impressed by that... We have a military industrial complex that is out of control. I know that there are countless military contractors foaming at the mouth as we speak, just waiting for Trump to get them some work. Both sides are pushing the ""best military in the world"" bullshit but I want the best education and best healthcare in the world. We can't claim either of those things, and that's an absolute joke.  So yeah, I think we're on the same page. 

This country has already forgotten what happens when you try trickle down and deregulation. We saw disastrous results as recently as 10 years ago, yet we're doing it all over again. A lot of banks went out of business, a lot of people lost their homes and their retirement funds, we almost lost most of our auto manufacturing industry, and then Obama got us out of that and got the economy booming, yet people had the nerve to say Obama destroyed our economy and Trump needed to fix it?  The people who went through the most recent recession didn't remember how that happened and didn't speak up?  Ridiculous how short term the memory is with the masses.

And yeah, people have forgotten how hated Bush was and how wrong that war was. I'm totally with you on that.

My only concern is that the two party system seems to me to be what we're stuck with. I don't know how to get the masses voting another way. So I simply have to advocate for the side that is right on most of the issues and my only hope for any progress is that the pettiness between the aisles tones down eventually through career politicians who are serving for the right reasons, and that hopefully presenting serious news like it is Entertainment Tonight and social media spreading of misinformation become things of the past.

e61ilpk,"Modern American Democrats aren't liberals - they're left-wing conservatives.

By the classical usage, the usage in place in most of the rest of the world, and the usage by which the things listed in this image are courtesy of ""liberals,"" ""liberals"" are those who prioritize individual liberty over governmental authority, as opposed to ""conservatives,"" who prioritize governmental authority over individual liberty.  Since both Democrats and Republicans prioritize governmental authority over individual liberty, they're both, by the classical definitions, ""conservatives.""

The term ""liberal"" stopped referring to advocates of individual liberty in the US in the wake of the Great Depression, when some number of then ""liberals"" took the position that poverty constrained liberty, so liberty was served by instituting social welfare programs, in spite of the fact that instituting those programs required greatly expanding governmental authority.  When this viewpoint started gaining news coverage, the press attributed it to ""liberals,"" and the characterization stuck.

Not coincidentally, it wasn't long after that that the term ""libertarian"" started to gain popularity, since that became the preferred term to describe those who were formerly known as ""liberals"" - those who advocated individual liberty.  Meanwhile, American ""liberals"" continued to move ever further to the authoritarian left.

At this point, the only thing that distinguishes American ""liberals"" from American ""conservatives"" is which specific policies and powers they want their authoritarian governments to pursue.  Which, again, by the classical usage and the usage still in place in most of the rest of the world, means that both are actually ""conservatives,"" just of two slightly different flavors.",democrats,5,1537047477.0,comment

e614ogr,"The right and associated media is deviously talented at redefining/rebranding people/terms through using them in negative contexts, regardless of any existing definition or facts. And doing it over, and over, and over until enough of their base eats it up.

This isn't new, but what's scary to see is how central it has become to mainstream conservatism, culminating with Trump. A sitting president whose main weapon during the campaign was, arguably, nicknames and one-liners. I get that that's not exactly what I started with, but my point is the detriment to the electorate. If you can convince someone to redefine a word or person simply because you say so, why wouldn't you be able to convince them that you are going to expand coverage and lower costs simply by saying ""because we're gonna have the best healthcare, the best"". You can't counter that with policy or the reality that a lot of people (minus one very important one) understand ""healthcare can be so complicated"".

The ability to redefine and demonize these terms effectively with a portion of their base opened the door for a campaign that succeeded in part by chanting ""lock her up"", ""build the wall"", and feel good one liners. Which now has opened the door for members of congress and electoral candidates to openly dismiss criticism simply by saying ""fake news"" or ""deep state"".

If that's an effective explanation for enough of the electorate, then we have effectively jumped the shark.

Edit: Don't get me wrong, the left has its own version of this. Obama, especially towards the beginning, ran with a less defined platform than Clinton in 2008 and leaned a bit on a lot of the ""hopey changey stuff"". But, he coalesced the closer the election got, whereas Trump doubled down again and again, and probably won because of it.",democrats,-1,1537033802.0,comment

A defining characteristic of both the extreme left and right is intolerance to opposing views. The first thing these groups invariably do once they have power is to shut down any opposing voice because they cannot stand to listen to anyone they don't already agree with.

Unfortunately our political system has come to enfranchise wingnuts and discourage the participation of centrists. Liberals and Conservatives are both endangered species. Conservatives have been driven out of their own party by the Trump movement they mistakenly opened the door for.  

It turns out Gerrymandering doesn't make your seat safe at all, it just makes you less vulnerable to other party and far more vulnerable to wingnuts within your own party. It turns out that having a platform of ""kicking out the establishment"" for 20 years was going to be interpreted by ring wing voters to mean kick everyone out, including moderate Republicans.

In response the left has become more engaged and enraged, and they too are forcing liberals out of ""safe"" seats.  The problem is these extremists would rather shoot each other than talk to each other. Listen to the rhetoric some time.

e61waa1,"Well... I can sort of see why you say that, at least in an American context, and it's true to some degree, but it's not quite accurate in the classical sense.

In a quasi-socialist oligarchy, like the former USSR, a supporter of capitalism would likely rightly be considered a liberal, while a supporter of the ""socialism"" that was already in place would likely rightly be considered a conservative.

Again, the classical distinction hinges on how people generally respond to situations in which governmental authority and individual liberty conflict.  If they come down on the side of governmental authority, they're conservatives, and if they come down on the side of individual liberty, they're liberals.

Granted though, to go back, in an American (or arguably most of the western world) context, you're pretty much right, since the ""capitalism"" that's in place is much like the ""socialism"" that was in place in the former USSR - it's really just the specific economic model the government has to work within as it goes about abusing its authority.  It's not quite as overt in the ""capitalism"" of the US as it was in the ""socialism"" of the USSR, but in both cases, what the government is really doing is expanding its own power to the benefit of itself and its cronies and patrons.  It's just that different economic systems require jumping through different sets of hoops in order to accomplish that goal.

And yeah - in some sense at least, it might be argued that opposing ""capitalism"" is a liberal position in the US, just because the ""capitalism"" in the US is so intertwined with and dependent upon authoritarianism.  And I think I could even make a case for a shift toward socialism being a liberal shift, since it would necessarily involve shifting at least some of the government's attention toward the benefit, and arguably even the liberty, of the citizens, as opposed to its longstanding almost single-minded focus on the benefit of itself and its cronies and patrons.

Edit - I just came back out after posting this and noted that I misread your post.  I thought you said that ""if you support capitalism, you aren't liberal.""

Mmm... yeah - I'd tend to say (not 100%, but pretty damned close) that ""left"" at least very strongly implies opposition to capitalism.  I can't really think of a reason to not say it's certain, other than that I'm not certain myself.

I'm not saying the left doesn't do it, there is absolutely convenient virtue signaling that takes place.

No liberal demonized the term liberal, I've never heard a liberal use the phrase ""the liberal agenda"".

The problem is that current conservative tendencies for taxes is to provide next to no tax cuts to the average consumer, in order to provide massive tax cuts to the people that don't ""need"" it. We need more tax brackets for the insanely wealthy. The highest tax bracket is reached at roughly 500k income. As of 2012, the top 400 incomes in the US averaged $335.7 million. Taxes cap out at 37% for anything beyond 500k. We should have tax brackets that grow all the way up to the 100's of millions, and should be plateauing in the realm of 80% at around $250 million. I know people view that as essentially expecting the rich to pay for everything for the poor, but there is a point where the extremely rich are simply not paying their fair share. I use fair share in a very loose sense, mostly under the idea that their quality of life is no longer being increased with more income, while their own employees are still barely getting by. The fact that people think fair taxes are having  people that make $500,001 and $400,000,000 in the same tax bracket is utterly insane.  That means there are people that literally make 800x as much money as people in the same tax bracket. That is the equivalent of people making minimum wage and people making $5,800 an hour being in the same tax bracket. Alongside this, we want to keep corporate tax rates low and strictly require disclosure of business expenditures in an attempt to prevent the mega rich from using corporate expenditures as personal spending. There needs to be incentive to have the mega rich put their money back into their business rather than reaching incomes of $1 million a day. I dont necessarily want to be punishing the rich, but there is a point when you're making so much money that you're essentially operating purely on greed.

e629gvp,"Rallying for the advancement of your belief is not the same as crushing those who believe differently. 

The Founders cautioned against the establishment of parties because they feared that form of thinking. They understood that a popular and well organized political machine could run elections and erode democracy. We can see that happening now with the DNC favoritism showed towards certain candidates, and the republican endorsement of criminal activity to further their ends. Both parties are incredibly flawed (although it seems like the republicans are worse).

The point of a party is to bring fractured voters under the fold so 16 candidates with similar viewpoints don't rob votes from each other. As a party you agree that no one person can possibility represent everyone, so you vote en masse for the candidates who's platforms best covers your broad views. At least that's what I was taught in my highschool civics class.

A voters allegiance is supposed to be to their own conscious, not blind party dogma. That's why respect for the minority is important. People's views can change and you may find your party on the losing side of an election. That doesn't mean the other party can say, pass a law forbidding your party. 

I don't know why you've been disenfranchised, but I have to assume it was for reasonable cause and not just because your political viewpoint is unpopular. Why?

e61yf89,"So let's say I pay $10,000 in taxes on a yearly basis, that is roughly 15% on a $70,000 salary. Somebody that makes $100M, at our current rate of 37%, pays $37M in taxes. That is 3700% more than me. Is that not fair share enough?  In your example of 80% at $250M, that number increases to 20000% more. Is that better?  What actually defines fair share?  How much is it?  As I said, there needs to be tax reform, I do not disagree with this. Maybe increasing the number of tax brackets is part of the solution, but on top of that loopholes in the tax law need to be closed as well, and perhaps take away tax breaks too, but then do you only take away the tax breaks from the rich, or to make it fair, take them away from everybody?

What's stopping people from taking less money to run a company? Instead of a salary of $100M, they take a salary of $100,000, with the rest being in stock options, something that has no taxable value until sold? And if sold sparingly enough, now we are back to the same problem, super rich not paying enough in taxes, because now their income is much less than it was previously. The rich didn't get to that point by being stupid, and they will always try and find a way to skirt paying anymore than they legally have to. And if you start taxing investment accounts on something that hasn't been sold, then you need to tax them for everybody, not just the rich, and all that does is hurt the common person by giving them another tax burden, as well. 

I agree that incomes are outrageous at times, and in your example of 80% at $250M, they would still net $50M, which is more than enough for anybody to retire on after only working for a year, and that it does account to greed at a certain point.

I really wish there was a very simple cut and dry answer to this so it could be implemented, but because of how this country is run, I don't believe it to be possible, not without getting everybody that is currently sitting in government out and replacing them entirely.

e626i1i,"I appreciate a thoughtful response. My goal here is to try and broaden my scope in order to focus my beliefs/values, ideally to draw closer to whatever ""truth"" there is.

I won't lay claim to either left or right having a moral high-ground. I would claim there are at least two kind of ""backdoors"" into someone's heart/gut. Fear and hope. Both can easily be misplaced and taken advantage of. But, I would argue that evolutionarily, fear is the larger and more effective button, to our peril.

As far as ad-hominem attacks, I won't deny that it does happen on the left as a convenient scapegoat to vilify an opponent or redirect focus. But, do you truly believe that the left does it more effectively/often than the right/Trump? Personally, I don't see the evidence for that. Again, when it comes to the left, we are discussing a single aspect, the idea of racism/race and its prevalence/effect. When it comes to the right/Trump, we are talking about entire narratives being crafted to conveniently move the goal posts, at best. Give supporters an out from using the same metrics they criticized Obama/hillary for, here comes ""fake news"" and ""deep state"". As the swamp gets thicker, it takes even more crafting via q-anon and I'm assuming others like that.

My point was that, until more recently, I had not heard as much from the left as much as the right, when it came to using arguably neutral terms ""the x agenda"" in inherently negative contexts. The right has been far more effective at this for decades, as I mentioned. The Southern Strategy and it's descendents is not a joke and is not uneffective politically. We are only recently seeing anything that could be considered a parallel on the left (basket of deplorables etc), or I would challenge you to present me with one that isn't anti-war during Bush, because all the sudden that's cool now.

Someone who only made 70 thousand and someone who made 250 million will pay the exact same taxes on that first 70k. Tax brackets only apply to the income that falls within the increment of that bracket. So someone who made 250 million pre taxes would end up making far more than 50 million after taxes.

I do not believe we should give a platform to anyone who believes any race, creed, sex, gender, etc. is inferior. I take no issue with campuses shutting people like that out. I do take issue with people being protested, interrupted, silenced, who have opinions and thoughts that differ from yours or mine. It is incredibly important that we listen to people who we don't agree with, outside of aforementioned bigots. It's just those types of people; those with differing thoughts that are being shut up. THAT IS DANGEROUS, history has taught us that.

To your initial point, I absolutely believe fact is superior to feelings or emotions. Stoicism is core to my belief system and I give absolutely no leniency to anyone who decides that their feeling or emotions are more important than facts or others opinions. You and I have the absolute human right to our feelings, that does not mean they must be respected by others. It is not convenient it is essential that facts, logic and valid arguments override feelings. I also never said nor do I believe that any one ideology uses facts, feelings, emotions, etc more than another.  I simply believe that your initial statement was in no way based on fact.  It happens everywhere not just private or public campuses, it is not  singularly maniacs or bigots that are being silenced and it is absolutely free speech that is being silenced, if you do not see that you are not paying attention.

I believe the term white nationalists is convenient. It's broad and poorly defined. Call them what they are racists, but do not lump people in because they believe in strict immigration policy. It does not matter if I agree with them, what matters is that we have a discussion and we come to some kind of consensus because it is not republicans who are hurting illegal or legal immigrants it is all of us. We can help those who would like to come to our nation by coming to a consensus, reforming law, and sticking to it. If we shut each other up we will NEVER comprise.

Simply put, your argument is bunk because it is in totality bunk. However, I respect the hell out of you for having conviction and what seems to be deeply rooted feeling and emotions towards the betterment of a nation and those who inhabit it. That is what we need, people with conviction, people who are willing to stand up and make themselves heard. On the internet, in public, everywhere.

To finish off this rant that nobody will likely read, and those who do will probably disagree with. I respect all valid arguments, I respect anyone who is willing to defend their beliefs, I do not respect your feelings nor will I ever. People are allowed to believe and defend what they believe in, but don't fucking tell someone they can't speak because they hurt someone else's fucking feelings. That's childish and unproductive.

e620xga,"True, I did a simplification of the taxes for talking purposes, but the point still applies, they make more money than they need to, and one of the reasons tax brackets do need to be changed, without a doubt.  My 3700% and 20000% is a bit misleading, though if I were to break it down, we'd still most likely be talking in the 1000's and 10000's, percentage wise.  I'm just playing devils advocate, is all.

As it currently stands, everybody tries to pay as little in taxes as they possibly can, the rich, poor and middle class alike.  It's just in our nature to keep what we earn and not want to give it away. The current tax law needs a complete overhaul, rebuilt from the ground up so that everybody does pay their fair share, and that is an undertaking I don't envy for anyone. Everybody has their own opinion on it, and is one of the reasons it hasn't been done, nobody can agree on anything.

We seem to be pretending the Republican party at large is not immensely pleased with Trump. Kicking a guy the majority of their party wanted in the white house out is huge gamble. [81% of the party likes him right now.](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx)

Trump is not an aberration of the Republican party, he's just a Republican without the mask or Lee Atwater filter. 

If they kicked him out and he had a 80% in party approval rating it'd cause a massive schism they couldn't recover fast enough from. 

All indication seems to be that the dems will win a few seats in the house in 2018 that nets them no advantage, but that the Republican party will not only have 1-3 additional seats in the senate (which means healthcare will be an easy vote) but will also potentially have enough officials for a constitutional convention, [which they really really want to do.](https://www.google.com/search?q=republican+constitutional+convention&oq=republican+constitutional+convention&aqs=chrome..69i57.3896j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)",democrats,115,1507653074.0,comment

This is because they all have competing wants, which I feel like you're missing.

They're not representatives of the country, they are representatives of their constituents, that's kind of the point. You're literally describing how it's supposed to work: Rep 'panders' to their district on behalf of what that district wants in order to stay in power. What you seem to like is a system where arbitrarily lame duck sessions are increased giving reps the ability to sell out to lobbying groups and private interests since there's no point not doing it at that time.

[If you don't believe me, here's 538's aggregate of all approval ratings putting it at 37.4](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/)

>And just because the Republican Base loves him doesn't mean he's not an aberration. 

His policies are not an aberration, nor is his love of culture war stuff. He's basically just a normal republican with the mask of 'respectability' removed.

>And just because the Republican Base loves him doesn't mean he's not an aberration. Hitler's base loved Hitler. I honestly can't understand why anyone would support him at this point. 

That's your issue, your judgement is clouded by a narrative you REALLY want to believe, that no one could REALLY support the guy. 

>He lies constantly, cannot get Congress to do anything without an executive order 

[He passed more individual bills in his first 100 days than Obama did.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/sean-spicer/trump-has-signed-more-bills-100-days-any-president/) While he's passed fewer 'important' bills, Obama got to ride a national wave of support due to the 2008 crash. There's zero reason to think he's not getting a ton done right now, especially because as president his job only really requires signing stuff. The house has already successfully voted to kill Dodd Frank for example, and it'll hit the senate at some point. [In fact, Republicans in the actual government are VERY happy Trump owns every headline because it lets them get a TON done behind the scenes and no one cares because Trump is the entire focus.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/what-trump-is-actually-accomplishing/535458/)

Combine this with the fact every indication we have seems to point to losing 1-3 senate seats to the republicans in 2018 due purely to placement (while losing a few house seats they don't even need), and the party will love him even more. 

>and even high ranking Republicans are distancing themselves from him.

You used plural here, who other than Corker is openly going after him in Republican leadership?

Again, it's real attractive to believe that the base of the Republican party doesn't love Trump, but they do. 

**Think of Obama and how you felt when he got elected. Think of your perception of the situation.**

**Now realize that [Trump](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) had a 1% higher in party approval rating on his day of inauguration than [Obama](http://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx).**

Obama had a much higher rating across the board, but you should realize how skewed your perception is when you make claims like ""Republicans at large are jumping ship because he's ruining the party!"" because other than a few outliers, they're all very very happy to own 3/3 branches of the federal government and let Trump be a whipping boy for the press so they can ransack everything not bolted to the floor.",democrats,15,1507667089.0,comment
do6otf1,"[They don't](https://www.cbpp.org/research/states-likely-could-not-control-constitutional-convention-on-balanced-budget-amendment-or), just like the original CC they get to write their own rules and procedures once in:

>A convention could choose a new ratification process.  The 1787 convention ignored the ratification process under which it was established and created a new process, lowering the number of states needed to approve the new Constitution and removing Congress from the approval process.  The states then ignored the pre-existing ratification procedures and adopted the Constitution under the new ratification procedures that the convention proposed.  Given these facts, it would be unwise to assume that ratification of the convention’s pro­posals would necessarily require the approval of 38 states, as the Constitution currently specifies.  For example, a convention might remove the states from the approval process entirely and pro­pose a national referendum instead.  Or it could follow the example of the 1787 convention and lower the required fraction of the states needed to approve its proposals from three-quarters to two-thirds.

An incumbent essentially has to anger their base to get removed, else why the hell would congress have such a huge disapproval rating across the nation?

If there was some way to remove that advantage, such as thoroughly educating our populace, and convincing them that voting isn't just something you do when you're unhappy, then term limits wouldn't be needed. 

Sadly, we're not going to get that, so Term limits should be enforced. The Senate has a built-in system that allows for junior senators to gain experience, with the 1/3 rotation. The term limit doesn't have to be something dumb like Cali did initially, it can be 3 or 4 terms in the Senate, 6-7 in the House. That gives a ""good"" Senator/Representative 12-18/12-14 years to make a difference, and would prevent the worst from staying in power through inertia, to the point of dementia.

So now my husband's citizenship may be denied  because we participated in a socially beneficial program which we were encouraged to take part in receiving financial aid and where as if we had never taken in this (beautiful, amazing) child there would be no conflict of interest, although who knows what the wellbeing of said child would have been. But if something should happen to my husband and were he to be deported now because they are making up any reason at this point (he has a clean record; we both do) I would have to file for bankruptcy and raise two children on my own (we had one child before we took in our foster baby)... you can bet I'd have to resort to financial support.

e3voszg,"That's actually exactly how racism works. Racism isn't a guitar chord that you have to play exactly right for it to exist; it's a series of complicated mechanics that have to be handled using broad stuff like equal opportunity employment because racists are always going to find ways to worm their racism in, like water finding a crack to seep into.

The plain undeniable fact is that social support like food stamps exist to serve people at a disadvantage, and people at an economic disadvantage tend to be people at a social disadvantage—i.e. people who don't look like Stephen Miller. This shitstrip doesn't have to be standing on the roof of the White House screaming the word ""nigger"" for every motivation behind every one of his policies to be nakedly, flagrantly racist. He wants to stain immigrants who have legally used social supports with a kind of scarlet letter just for being poor. It's every rich white man's argument against everyone else: if they receive a certain kind of benefit, they must be scamming *me.* Never mind my own benefits, which don't come in the form of food stamps but are nonetheless present, and practically innumerable. It might look like economic elitism at a glance, but trust that it's racism. That same guy is using 23andme to ooh and ahh at his family's rich history, but fuck the black dude from Somalia who just fled a war zone to keep his kids alive.

Deciding that people who are following a legal inroad to citizenship and have used social support on the way are now going to be barred will affect some people who look like Stephen Miller (and, I imagine, you). But by and large it will impact people who don't, and at this point the administration's attitude toward immigrants—essentially an institutional obsession with Mexicans and muslims—is so unapologetically biased that it's comical to pretend that there's any sort of blind justice behind it.

There is a real human cost to these sorts of budget cuts, but that doesn't mean there isn't merit to the argument that we can be more economically stringent in terms of our immigration policy. I don't necessarily agree with his proposal in entirety, especially since it may result in people who need these benefits avoiding taking them out of fear of delaying citizenship.

In general, if we could have a better paths for people to get themselves off of welfare, these sorts of issues might solve themselves... Unfortunately it's easier to just make simple sweeping solutions than campaign for complex and comprehensive change.

dskezgx,"Great point!  I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite choosing Sanders in the primary.  And I also voted for John Kerry despite choosing Kucinich in the primary.  But let's expand your wonderful point.

1) Just admit that you're talking to the 28% of Hillary Clinton supporters who voted for McCain/Palin in 2008.  After all, in 2016, only 12% of Sanders supporters voted for Republicans.  Clinton supporters were much more prone to the behavior you decry.

2) I get it.  You thought that Obama ""stole"" the nomination from Her in 2008 http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/documentary_claims_obama_campa.html  I'm not persuaded by those arguments, but even if they're true and Hillary Clinton wants to run again - which is her perfect right - let's not pre-select a candidate years in advance of the '20 primary https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774, let's have an open primary and evaluate all candidates.

3) If candidate A polls ten points better against Trump than candidate B, let's take that into consideration, and let's not make arguments that ""the polls will suddenly reverse if Candidate A is selected.""

4) When good progressive ideas are strongly popular, let's run on those ideas.  Compromise is only rational when it helps to win an election.  Al Gore didn't run on legal gay marriage in 2000, but if it had had 65% public support at that time, it would have made sense for him to do that.  ""Centrist"" means what people in the center want.  

5) Let's think long and hard before nominating another candidate with 60% disapproval rating.  Of course the 2016 election was close, because both candidates had 60% disapproval.  But if either party had thought of running a more popular candidate, it might have been less close.

Even in the unlikely event that Hillary Clinton ""would have"" beaten John McCain (we now know that's unlikely, even in the strong Democratic year of 2008, because McCain was a much, much stronger candidate than Trump), that's true for many candidates who didn't win their primary.

It does not actually dictate that the money is spent in any certain way or towards any particular charity or cause, and there is no legal obligation to actually donate any money.

  &nbsp;  
See h_lance's posts above for what a real troll and/or myopic, hyper purist, True Scotsman Fallacy tainted, self destructive, troll looks like.    
  &nbsp;  
This country had 8 years of brilliance, dignity, and class with Barack Obama, and Hillary would have carried on that dignity with a progressive social agenda that would have seen nationwide broadband, even in the smallest of coal towns. Unfortunately, that message and those promises were drowned out entirely by a vapid, superficial, and borderline complicit MSM that only ever wanted to talk about a fake email scandal, showing the Trumpanzee's empty podium, and shrieking about every shocking thing he was saying.  
  &nbsp;  
However, even that wouldn't have been enough to flip the election to Trump. It took the addition of Russian microtargeting of Trump and Bernie supporters with fake news and propaganda that lead to voter depression and 3rd party support in key swing states. This is why you see Trump voters and the far fringe of Bernie supporters echoing the same Fox/InfoWars/Kremlin talking points, which you can see in full display above.  
  &nbsp;  
Now coming back around to my OP, which is nothing more than a copypasta, in 2020 we will be once again subject to the same kind of, if not more sophisticated, Russian disinformation campaign against not just Trump supporters, but those who would seek to create division and would rather burn the house down than see anyone but their idol of purity lose the nomination. A sensible person would have the perspective to unite behind the democratic nominee, as I did when I supported Bernie in the primary, but threw my support behind Hillary when it was apparent he had lost. A non-sensible person, well, just read the posts above and then reflect upon how important the minuscule differences between Bernie and Hillary were to you when held up against the daily assault on our constitution, morality, culture, and world standing.  
  &nbsp;  
There will be a candidate in 2020 you may not entirely agree with. You will probably be fed negative propaganda about them by Russian trolls who want to divide the democratic base and propel the draft dodging, Grifter-in-Chief to a 2nd term, but you have to put those differences in perspective, put country over party, over sectarian, hyper purist ideology, and vote for them. It could be Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Booker, Garcetti, Newsome, Biden, and yes, it could be Winfrey.

dsjvlbx,"Raise taxes on upper earning brackets in a way that actually scales to the billionaire level. Close loopholes on taxes and simplify tax coding overall to decrease overhead in managing the tax process in the country.

Decrease spending as a justification for getting a bigger budget. Have actual experts in a given field give honest assessments of needs and scale funding accordingly. In doing so, decrease excess of spending on the ""corporate welfare"" fields associated with military industrial and prison industrial complexes. 

Legalize marijuana and tax it as a luxury item like Colorado. At the very least, decriminalize it so the prison system isn't an overburdened mess rife with opportunity for private backers to gouge tax dollars.

He's mentioned or intimated these as methods repeatedly over the years. How exactly has Trump, any major Republican, or Hillary (aka Republican lite, if that's your preference) expanded on ways to decrease frivolous spending and reinvest in infrastructure for our various failing systems.

dsjxr7i,"One reason for the DNC’s “bias” might be the fact that (as mentioned above, yet always conveniently ignored) Senator Sanders was not a Democrat and still is not a Democrat, while Hillary Clinton has been a hugely important member of the party for as long as many of us can remember. If Sanders wanted the DNC’s support, he should have swallowed his pride and became a member of the party. Would the GOP have been expected to support Donald Trump’s candidacy had he not formally joined the Republican Party? Hell no they wouldn’t. That would have been beyond crazy. Also, no potential candidates (apart from Vice President Biden, who opted not to run) on the Democratic side had any realistic chance of defeating Clinton, who in spite of a decades-long campaign by the right (and unfortunately, by some on the left) to defame her character, remains highly respected and admired among the Democratic base. She’s also a fantastic fundraiser and was the consensus pick of the Democratic establishment. When you take all of those factors into consideration, it’s not hard to see why nearly all (with the exception of Martin O’Malley, who suspended his campaign very early) other Democrats felt that they just wouldn’t be able to compete with her. They all had a choice to run, but they chose to sit out and support Hillary Clinton instead. You may think that the DNC “fixed” it for her, but it’s ultimately up to the voters, and while you chose Sanders, Democratic voters overwhelmingly chose Hillary Clinton to be their nominee, even without super-delegates. She was absolutely more than “decent” if unexciting, and undeniably more qualified than her opponent in the general election.

Also, the GOP had 17 candidates to choose from not because their cup runneth over with talent but because it was, in fact, so empty that a deranged internet troll/reality TV star was able to swoop in and take their nomination, an embarrassment of catastrophic proportions for the GOP until he tragically managed to actually win the election. Having that many choices just causes the process to be taken over by the loudest voices in the room, which as we have all witnessed over the past year or so, does not always produce desirable results. However, I do look forward to having a slightly deeper pool of Democratic talent to choose from in 2020, which is likely to happen as there is no obvious frontrunner yet in this election cycle.",democrats,1,1515725429.0,comment

ed99lbg,"Yes you do, dramatically so. 

There is no such thing as being ""majority"" black; you either are black or are not black. ""Blackness"" is not and has never been defined in terms of realistic biology or culture--it is an abiological term based on arbitrary classification--and thus can not be statistically divided based on anything real, like being ""part Irish"". Blackness means and has always meant ""other people's perception of you as not white"". 

Race in general is defined as other people's perception of you as belonging to a class vaguely defined by a collection of features most notably skin color. This general perception of someone as belonging to an arbitrary class indicates the kind of assumptions that people make when interacting with them. Acknowledging that people who have historically been perceived as belonging to the arbitrary class of black vs white--who have thus had dramatically different privileges and experiences--is not racism. Acknowledging that historically this woman would have belonged to the class of people which was systematically denied rights, respect, bodily autonomy, repesentation, and political participation is not bigotry. 

The one drop rule you refer to was a legal approach which co-opted language from biology to justify an expansive policy of bigotry and exclusion. It generally applied to people who individually were perceived as white but had ancestors who would have been classified by the general populace as black. Their ancestors status as being black was used to continue to deny rights, privileges, ownership, and respect to people who were black adjacent--a way to continue to exclude blacks and blackness from the privileges and access that whites enjoyed in society. Saying that this is just ""the one drop rule"" is to naively attest that the one drop rule ceased having relevance on society when it was abolished and to pretend that societies perception of someone as black due to having any amount of ""blackness"" in their family tree ended when the law changed. Thus, acknowledging that she has had experiences of inequality due to societies perception of her as a black person and understanding that she is one of a long history of people who have experienced the same and worse, and that despite all that, she has been able to be politically active and gain a position of moderate power is to paint a full picture of how hard she has had to work to get where she is.

What a bunch of garbage.

Zero living Democrats ""founded the KKK"", instituted Jim Crow, segregated schools, or assassinated MLK.  

But I guarantee with 100 percent certainty that if you polled current Ku Klux Klan members on their current party affiliation, you'd see an OVERWHELMING majority of Republicans.  The Ku Klux Klan has ALWAYS been a Conservative, far-right organization...and the fact that the Democrats USED to be the conservative party is largely irrelevant to this fact.  

But you knew all of that, didn't you?  You knew that the KKK is full of conservatives.  That they endorsed Trump.  So you came here, and you spread this intentionally misleading propaganda, with the hopes of...what?  Fooling Democrats into quitting the party based on something that happened a century ago?  Changing their mind and supporting Trump, to spite the ""founders"" of the Klan - who, if they were alive today, would absolutely, unquestionably, have voted for him?

In practice, yes.  But you didn't make that argument.  You said Nazism was based on good ideals of self-improvement, and socialism was based on ""genocide and rape"".  That was not a debatable point, nor a question of nuance - it was a lie.  It was revisionist history, and you tried to defend Nazis.  And then, after defending Nazis, you came here to revise not only history, but our CONVERSATION, to act like all you'd done is point out that Communism had lead to more death than Nazism. How shameful!

>The communists committed the worse racial genocide.

Which race was targeted by the Communists for extermination?  Are you going to say that it was white Europeans, and that they were targeted by Jewish Communists, based on race?  Save your breath - it's just more Nazi revisionist garbage.

You also have to pay all of the people in the parade even though they are away from their normal posts and not doing their normal work.  You also have to consider the costs associated with security, blocking off major roads in one of the most densely populated cities in the US, and probably a whole host of other expenses that I’m not thinking of.   We’re talking millions of dollars of tax money, to accomplish what?   A “show of strength”?  Our military is all over the earth.  There’s no question with regards to the strength of our military.

Trump has a bad tell. When he’s annoyed and want reporters out he repeatedly yells “thank you very much”. 

Worse than that his staff are not well organized and do not have the respect of the press pool. This is why you hear them screaming, literally rudely screaming at the reporters to leave, pushing them out because they want it over ASAP. They know this is often when the president says something damning off the cuff. He’s done that repeatedly. 

I’m saddened to see them degrade the decorum of the White House like this. It’s become a scrum. It hasn’t been nearly this bad in any other administration that I can recall. ",democrats,4,1535450928.0,comment

In the case of Molly Tibets' death, commentary from the right was intended to serve political purposes (to distract from Omarosa tapes, to forward an anti immigration agenda) - not to honor a life, mourn a tragedy, celebrate an accomplishment, etc.. In the case of McCain's death, there are relatively simple ways to do any of those things, and any of those things would not have to serve political purposes. Try one on:

""It's not news that McCain and I disagreed on many things. But I'll say this - he was a fighter, he never backed down, and I will always respect that.""

Two sentences, no political agenda, no ground given up. But, the reality is, Trump could never utter those two sentences, because these two sentences are a win-win, and he doesn't believe in win-win.",democrats,23,1535420262.0,comment
e4y98v1,"Yes. See, Mollie wasn’t a career politician, she didn’t know the president personally. 

Additionally, the left isn’t being tactless about her death or McCain’s.

While the right is being disrespectful about *both* their deaths and being vile towards Mollie’s family, who, as private citizens, should be allowed to grieve privately right now, and have people respect their opinion on their own child’s death, rather than having to deal with a bunch of lunatics publicly “correcting” them as though those strangers gained ownership of Mollie and her murder, and have more rights to an opinion on her death than her actual fucking loved ones do. 

The basis of your question boils down to you equating the left saying “please don’t shit on dead people, guys” with the right feeling entitled to actually shit on dead people and following that up by pretending the left are horrible, hypocritical oppressors for continuously saying: srsly. pls no, guys.

e4y5mcb,"I feel for you. As a democrat I struggle with the same thing. He's shown that he doesn't have a lot of tact (or purposefully projects a tactless personality), and I honestly don't need innumerable instances of that fact from here to eternity. 

But on the other hand, ""finding fault in literally everything he does or doesn't do"" IMO basically describes Republicans' attitudes towards Obama during his presendency (remember the idiocy of the american flag pins?). The only difference is this is on Twitter and not on Michael Savage's talkshow. 

I know ""but they started it"" is a juvenile argument (and I'm not even sure that's a defensible position given you could say the same thing about democrat's attitude to bush, etc...), but that's where we are. We live in a juvenile society. If you don't like that fact (and I don't), then note that the process of becoming less juvenile is the process of maturation. And maturing requires some self-reflection and consideration of the ways in which your own actions contribute to that thing that you don't like (in this case, drive-by, low-content smears at political figures).

take the beam out of your own eye, etc. 

To be clear I'm not accusing you personally since I don't know what you were doing during Obama's presidency, and what I wrote above applies equally to the OP. 

Also to the Democrats reading this I think it behooves all of us to think about what we're trying to accomplish by spreading bits of trivia like the OP. I don't think the tone of the OP is going to convince any conservative of anything beyond that expressed in the post I'm replying to (i.e., they're going to criticize him no matter what). And I get that this is a democratic space for democrats to post democrat things, and if the poster of the OP really believes that this action is a severe departure from past precedent in meaningful ways then I don't fault him/her for posting. But lets try to raise the level of discourse shall we? If its bad when the president tweets low-content garbage then its bad when we do it too.

By advocating for American boots on the ground everywhere from Kosovo to Sudan? His suggestions for Libya sound like something the Pentagon would've written about Vietnam in 1962. That's to say nothing of his support for our interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

After all of his experiences in captivity, he wasn't even willing to take a moral stand on torture.

e4zn8z7,"What Trump seems incapable of comprehending is that it wasn't McCain getting captured that made him commendable, it was the torture he endured especially after he declined being released earlier than his fellow POWs which was commendable.

Self-sacrifice is something our current POTUS is simply incapable of comprehending, and dedication to anything higher than oneself is simply impossible for him because in his own mind there could never be anything higher than DJT. Not even on a theoretical level. Thus he's incapable of anticipating the feelings and reactions of those who can and do appreciate and value self-sacrifice and dedication to things higher than themselves. All that can be said for Trump is that he's a good enough politician to recognize when he's screwed up, even if he can't fathom how or why he screwed up.",democrats,1,1535482074.0,comment

I have always said that I’m going to make an annual trek to his grave to shit all over it. Will I really though? It’ll probably be unmarked or guarded. What if someone could actually rob his grave and get a hold of his corpse? What would someone like me do to his corpse if I brought it out into the woods with only a WebCam and an Internet connection? Would I hook him up to some strings and pulleys and make him talk, then push to YouTube? What I would probably do is hook him up to some giant weather balloons, Then release him into the desert sky. I would do it in some bumblefuck southern state that supported him, so when he came crashing back down to earth he might have a high likelihood of falling through some supporters roof. That would be something.

I think the news of his demise will be the second most celebrated event in America over the last century. The first probably will be when his tubby, lying ass is thrown out of office.

Problem is the republican Congress refuses to act against him. He's fulfilled a lot of the promises they have wanted, from tax cuts to strengthening boarders from illegal immigration, so they would rather stay complicit in his actions and just bear the brunt of the bad pr for the sake of maintaining power. Those who voice against trump get blasted by the party. Only republicans who are really voicing and pushing against him are those who are on the way out of the party. Anyone who feels they still have their career ahead of them will support him or refuse to stop him. The republicans are so desperate to maintain power, they even blocked a movement by democratic senators to strengthen defence for the elections against further Russian meddling [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/19/us/politics/ap-us-congress-election-security.html) 

The only way to stop him is for Americans to vote the republicans out of Congress in the midterm elections in fall, and bring a majority of democratic senators in (I say americas since I'm Canadian). If the democrats can secure a majority, they will be able to stop a lot of his antics or fully impeach him if the situation demands it.

e308ckz,"So 3 things:

1) The main reason Trump has decent numbers among military at all is because of appointing Mattis (that’s especially why Marines are so high on him). Mattis is a living folk hero to everyone but the SF community. 

2) The other reason is because of spending. I was in for Obama and the first few months of Trump. It went from QMPing E7’s for shit they did at 18, to $30k bonuses for signing up as a cameraman, literally the day he took office. Now that costs a TON of money and I have no idea what they paid for it with, because the budget was set before he took office. But that money doesn’t get down to officers, because they’ve gotten their free college already.

3) Part of me resents the whole calling officers educated bit. I know it’s just anecdotal, but I always hated that. I had an Economics degree and I enlisted and was an NCO. Loved being an NCO and wouldn’t trade it for being an officer at all. But officers over me had massively useless degrees, but they got to commission just because their degree in “fine arts studies” was a degree. But that’s just my own personal soap box. 

For 2020 purposes, the military will likely lean Trump again big time, regardless of visiting. Anyone who has had a VIP visit would rather not deal with that BS again. BUT, I’m not so sure that the military will bother voting en masse in 2020. I have long suspected 2020 will for for Republicans like 2016 did for Dems, Trump still has a decent sized support base but many of them don’t bother showing up to the polls - military or not.

They don't like brown people and they want white men in charge because they think that is how it should be. 

They have a fantasy nostalgia in their mind of their childhood and early adulthood where they didn't understand what really went on in the world. All they saw American leaders being strong and standing up to communism. They didn't know what was really going on they just had a perception of a strong America. 

You get into the 80s and through today and they understand better what is going on in the world but refuse to believe the same things were happening when they were younger because they think America wouldn't let it happen like the libruls do today. 

They are in a fantasy world where they truly believe white men are the best leaders for the country. God and Jesus are white to them so that is who they think should be in charge. Many truly believe that God made white men to rule other races because only white Christian men know what is best for everyone. 

 If a candidate has an R by their name and claims to be a Christian they will vote for them. What they do in office doesn't matter as long as they keep making their constituents believe that they are doing God's work. 

They base their opinions and vote based on their emotions. How something ""feels"" to them is all that matters. They feel that libruls are going to turn the country over to illegal immigrants and Muslims and in 10 years we will be living under Sharia law and eating Mexican food. They are full of fear and paranoia and that is what drives them. 

You cannot assign logic to their decisions because there is none. The GOP base votes on emotions and whatever propaganda against anyone without white skin is put in front of them.

While the Western media love characterizing certain troubled states, such as Venezuela, as ""socialist,"" this usage of the term is a misnomer. No nations in modern history have been socialist. 

There is no reason to believe that a society whose means of production are collectively shared must be, or will likely result in totalitarianism. In fact, the exact opposite would be expected. Oppression has fertile ground to manifest in *non*-egalitarian systems such as capitalism, where the means of production are owned by private entities and used to profit off the labor of workers. Hence, why our society is incredibly oppressive in a variety of ways.

This is not only about silencing dissent but about declaring war on anyone who will print fact and hold Trump accountable for his deluge of lies.  

The man literally admitted on live television that he replies ""fake news"" on anything he doesn't like just to discredit the press to his base. 

Declaring Acosta a *rude and abusive asshole* is not only a pathetic justification for clamping down on anyone who asks tough questions but the accusation of abusiveness was patently false.

You probably don't get it because your nearest point of reference is a Comic Con where the point is to cram as many hygiene optional fans as can fit into a convention center and extract as much cash from them as possible. 

The Constitution of the United States was not a document written to restrain the powers of Comic Con and attendees have no 1st Amendment rights at Comic Con and Comic Con is in no way accountable to attendees of Comic Con. 

Elected officials don't get to decide who asks them questions, what those questions are, and they don't get to send interns to rip microphones away from them when you don't like it. The 1st Amendment was written specifically for this scenario, to restrict governmental power from becoming unaccountable to the people by restricting press unfavorable to them, and this Acosta issue is an escalation of Trumps continued practice to do just that. 

Your claim that a comic con is more relatable to Reddit but that's really just commenting on your own subscriptions and how little you know anything about what you're talking about.

Gender is made up. I don't care how other people decide to categorize it. Nobody says gender dysmporphia isn't a medical condition (at least most people dont). The point is to treat them like human beings. The fact that you call them ""transvestites"" tells me you haven't looked into this issue much.

It's no secret that Federal LEOs hate Dems in general, and Clinton's email server was a giant 'fuck you' to them by virtue of valuing her ability to control her account over opsec. Keep in mind that Clinton personally sent out multiple emails during her tenure reminding people that using a private account to talk about State Department issues is a security risk. Combine that with their general ire towards anyone left of Kissinger and you can see where the pressure really is.

Hell, the Comey letter wasn't leaked by the FBI, but by congress. That said, this is a big reason that the party REALLY should have focused on getting Warren to run rather than letting her get strong armed by HRC's donors. Putting all your eggs in one basket is a very very bad idea. I'm not a huge Martin O'Malley fan, but he 100% called the election, that if Clinton won the entire election would be about her emails and that messes with the parties ability to get any kind of message out.

>I'm not sure what you're talking about, AFAIK nobody knew about the laptop except for the FBI, and Comey was the sole decider for releasing that information just before the election, possibly influenced by fear of more uncontrolled leaks

You're right I got mixed up on that and the initial FOIA request.

That said, the Comey letter seemed a good idea. The main issue is they didn't write one about investigating Trump. 

My big theory is it had nothing to do with fear, but rather he 'knew' Clinton would win anyway and wanted to make sure he wasn't kicked out of the fun high level shit he loves when his own party hates him. ",democrats,2,1517850354.0,comment

I don't think any of this was done intentionally, as Comey has been shown to be of stellar integrity but with a bit of a God complex. I do however, think this adds to the pattern of the FBI acting improperly in ways damaging to democrats, while the leaks and sloppy leadership stop when a republican is under investigation.

eaiixkm,"Ok this is wrong on so many levels. 

Let’s start with the good old “innocent until proven guilty” approach. Even if every single person affected their had publicly said they plan on illegally crossing the border and were indeed planning on doing that, they still are not guilty of any US crime. You can’t be guilty of something you have yet to do. This conflicts with the whole basis of the US justice system where you aren’t supposed to be punished unless you are actually found guilty of a crime. You can’t just punish someone for a doing nothing wrong because you think they will commit a crime soon. 

Next point, you’re painting all of these people as being guilty (they aren’t) by association. Let’s say a small group of a migrant caravan does indeed illegally cross the US border. That small group are now criminals according to US law. The rest of the caravan is not. They still have done nothing against US law. You can’t punish the whole group just because some members broke the law. I’ll even make this more controversial by throwing even t_d. Some members of that sub have broken the law. This is proven fact. That does not mean we can just arrest every member of that sub (yes, the sub can be banned as Reddit is a private company and can police their own site however their wish. That’s a whole other topic though). You are not just guilty by association (there is very few exceptions and this is not one of them). 

Let’s create a character. I’m going to call her Sue. Let’s say she was at the border and was with this group that we call the caravan. Sue got gassed. Can you prove that Sue specifically planned on breaking any law or planned to illegally cross the border? Can you price that Sue didn’t just want to go for a walk? Even if Sue was going to break a law, she hadn’t done it yet. You can’t prove with any significant evidence that they were going to break any laws. 

You can’t be guilty of standing near a border. What the US troops at the border did was completely unnecessary and unacceptable. If they wanted to gas the people who climbed over the wall onto American soil, that’s sadly fine. While it is still most likely an excessive use of force (depending on how many people are on both sides of the situation), at least in this case their would be a legal reasoning for their actions. 

Depending on border relations, some countries would consider this to be an act of war. The US government is continually acting more and more stupid and ignorant and it’s just going to end in us being totally secluded from a majority of the world. Nobody wants to be friends with the crazy kid committing war crimes and throwing tear gas into other countries (at foreigners who broke no US law and most likely have never even stepped on US soil in their lives).

They have closed the port of entry to them, inspite of knowing they were coming and having plenty of time and resources to process them.
