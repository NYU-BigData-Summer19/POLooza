c6ndbi3,"Here's the thing: It's not Mitt's fault, it's the system's fault.  

I'll be honest (and hey, I'm so pro-Obama and Progressivism it's sickening!), if I was in Mitt's position, I'd play the same way (legally, like him).  I'd make a shit load of smart investments and just wait for the cash to flow back in when they succeed.  The gov't says I'll only get taxed 15% on my profit from it, so I win.

That's our system.  I kind of don't mind that as much.  But at the same time, for someone who is at the top of that system and making bank like that, has no right telling me, or the rest of America how they don't need all the programs that help keep them above poverty.

Mitt is completely out of touch with America/reality.  Obama at least LIVED on the crappier side of the economy and, quite literally, WORKED HIS WAY UP to be PRESIDENT.  The dude was fed on food stamps and low-wage overtime from his mom and grandmother. <---That's America, that needs to be changed.

First off most bonus's are considered supplimental income and are taxed at either 25% or on a Aggregated rate which can be more or less depending on varring factors.

Secondly, Romney's collecting money on investments that's not earned income and nor should it be.  He is having his money make money which is perfectly legal. Should he pay some percentage of that to taxes sure and he does.

I get it, we hate the tax system but lets not fault either party here for the way it is.   The reality is the system is broken it was created by bankers for bankers and the IRS is crap.

So your first $8,500 is taxed at 10%. Then if you make more than $8,500, your income between $8,500 and $34,500 is taxed at 15%. If you make more than $34,500, then your income between $34,500 and $83,600 is taxed at 25%. 

So each person is actually taxed at multiple different rates. The rich are taxed on their first $83,600 dollars at the same rates that a person who only makes $83,600 is taxed at. It's just that the rich generally have more income than $83,600, and so they continue to have additional income taxed at additional rates.

If the company is a success, they pay the share holders back according the percentage of the company they own.  If the company is a failure, the investors took a risk and lost.

Globalization has seen much of the rest of the world start catching up to US income levels, and companies are now global.  The leaders of those companies, many of which are in the US, have reaped huge rewards b/c of the vast new markets for their companies.  However, the same menial laborers whose jobs have been lost to globalization have gone no where.   Its almost as if Menial laborers have now a few billion more people to compete with (and wage competition/living standard abroad mean their former payscales will never come back for high school grads, etc).

If you look at the entire economic history from 1800-present day, the US has grown at about 2% per year...even during the depression their was a dip, but we caught back up to the trendline by the 60's (like the depression never happened).  Throughout these 200 years, the size of government has ranged from small (3% of GDP in 1800's to 25% (today)).  Meanwhile the economy keeps growing at a consistent rate.  My point is that way to much credit/blame is givin to politicians.  The main thing that causes economic growth is the generally free, capitalistic,educated, law abiding society that we have.  While we have that, the growth rate won't materially change(no politician's policies as of today come remotely close to hindering any of those things, or conversely, no politicians policies will result in a growth rate above 2%)

I also agree that the costs are outrageous but that's what she's been billed. I don't know the reasons behind it but because she has no insurance, she's inpatient every time she gets chemo, otherwise she'd just come in for the I.V. or take the I.V. chemo home with her. Which seems stupid because I would think it would be cheaper for the hospital to keep her outpatient.

It's not forced though as its contingent only if a state says YES to the $100 Million+ they would get for Medicare expansion and cover if the said yes to the Mandate, which acts as a tax again to pay for said expansion in additional revenue from healthcare provider taxes. So far all of the republican GOP/Republican Governor run states have stopped to say wether they will block this outright now because this is a real re-election killer. To say ""NO"" they will not take the 100+ million in state funding for their Medicare programs is basically political suicide. Only Gov Bob McDonnell of Virginia, Gov Crazy McNutt Job of Arizona, Gov Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Gov Skeletor of Florida, and Gov Sam Brownback of Kansas have said anything about outright blocking the medicare expansion and the Affordable Care Act as a whole still after the ruling.

The real killer though is all of the other new rules in this still apply such as people can't get kicked off healthcare at all, medicare medical coverage for people 133% the poverty line, Taxes on tanning salons, yadda yadda.

c585v17,"[This page](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-compensation-11_Stephen-J-Hemsley_NBHE.html) breaks down Hemsley's compensation in 2010 pretty well. He didn't make an outrageous salary or bonus for a CEO of one of the world's largest healthcare companies, he made $3.25 million (still a pretty incredible amount). Forbes' research shows that the reason he made ~$100 m is because he has a great deal of investment in UNH. The vast majority of his compensation was due to stock gains, because UNH gained over 30% in value during FY2010. Also, that one year is a clear outlier, it represents 80% of his total compensation at the company, according to Forbes.

[Here](http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=200985&ticker=UNH:US) is BusinessWeek's research, and I'd gladly take Bloomberg's word over Forbes'. It lists his compensation as approximately $13.4 m for 2011. $13.4 million, yes, is quite rich. Consider, though, that the company gained something like $10 billion in value during FY2011. BusinessWeek breaks it down even more, showing Hemsley's compensation is almost *entirely* stock options. So he's getting paid to increase the value of the company. And he did a good job one year.

There's no real problem with this. CEOs get huge payoffs if they perform well (and often if they don't).

Though I think having private insurance is ultimately inefficient and wrong, they didn't directly make money off of pain and suffering. They made money off of having people pay more in then they pay out.

Your responses started by saying this:

> This already happens in some areas. 

That is incorrect. In the story linked, the fire department's reason for not driving out to the fire has nothing to do with the existence or lack of insurance. That would be absurd. It has to do with whether or not a rural resident has signed up for an offered service from a city in another part of the county.

They are providing a service, putting out fires, and these people are upset because they didn't pay this service. Everyone inside the city does, it's called taxes and the city has authority over that, but these people don't live within the authority of the city so they have to pay a fee if they want that protection(service). Easy fix would be for the county to raise taxes and pay the city for fire services. Not leave it up to individuals to pay a fee they can be negligent about or ""forget"" to pay. 

Also, their taxes go to police services, but these people outside the city limits have that too, they're called County sheriffs",progressive,2,1341180519.0,comment
c586kaj,"Thanks for your response.  At one time insurance companies made money while paying a reasonable rate for billing.  Some were mutuals and some were servicers who made their way with fees.  If one looks closely, one finds that most profit streams are brought into holding companies and financial services companies.  The base concern then changes from service for a fee to maximizing the fees and eventually a squeezing of the rate payers and service providers to that of ever maximizing the amounts that they may retain.  Where once we had a service or utility model to deal with, we now have a *firm* that must deny ever more outlays and retain ever growing accumulations not for enhanced services or reserves but pure executive compensation and stock holder equity.

cqo75w6,"I'm not super rich, likely never will be, and certainly won't inherit enough to be amongst those taxed.  But, I don't like the estate tax for two reasons.  First, I think it's wrong to tax the estate of the deceased.  And second, it does absolutely NOTHING to solve the wealth distribution issue in the US.  That tax is nothing more than a show pony paraded around by politicians to convince the people that they're on their side.  

My first point is just my personal beliefs.  But, I have no problem with others feeling differently.  And, I'm open to feedback from those who feel the tax is essential.  But, at the end of the day, if you take a step back, that tax solves nothing.  There is a saying (and I apologize for it's offensiveness) that money flows from dumb to smart.  I don't agree that money moves from dumb people to smart people, but there is no question that money (in general) moves from the hands of the uneducated to the educated/strategic/fiscally prudent.  Just for argument's sake, let's assume we could take every dollar in the US and evenly divide it amongst those who were 18 or older.  Within 20 years, the money would primarily be back in the hands of today's wealthy.  Why?  B/c those who are great at making AND keeping money do so b/c they have good educations, are strategic decisions makers, are highly ambitious, are good with money management, network, and have either some natural talent or good ideas.  There is a reason most lottery winners end up broke...........they do not have the attributes necessary to HOLD ONTO wealth.  So then, why do we allow politicians (and ignorant journalists) corrupt us by perpetuating a myth that taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor is the solution?  

If you want to solve the wealth gap, you don't lower the ceiling, you raise the floor.  And you do that by empowering, enabling, and encouraging the poor.  Our poverty programs in America are a joke.  Yes, they keep people from starving to death, freezing to death, etc.  But, none of them are designed to give people the tools to climb out of AND stay out of poverty.  Our education system is an embarrassment.  The best teachers go to the best & richest neighborhoods.  We have allowed our state & federal governments to turn teachers into robots, by instituting a paint-by-numbers teaching approach that robs teachers of their ability to direct a classroom, discipline students, take kids on educational detours, create & invent, contour classes to student needs, etc.  It would be the equivalent of sending fighter pilots on a mission in which the plane was controlled remotely, and the pilot's sole responsibility was to oversee the plane and push a few buttons.  They're going to get killed, b/c the decisions and actions are a lot different when education is directed by people with no skin in the game, who are managers, not teachers........vs people who went into teaching b/c they love kids, want to give to kids, and are willing to sacrifice income potential to empower the next generation.

Also, for political gain, we have eliminated any incentive for the poor to remove themselves from poverty.  And in many respects, we've made it financially impossible to escape poverty, b/c in order to become self-sufficient, you generally have to take a pay cut when getting off gov't programs.  I spent 365 days homeless in Los Angeles in '00-01.  So, while I do not know what long-term poverty feels like, I do have some first hand experience with what it's like to have no home, no money, need handouts, etc.  The way we phase people out of poverty programs is inane, b/c you physically have to take a pay cut to become 100% self-sufficient.  

Our politicians also ignore, for political purposes, sensitive topics related to poverty, such as absentee fathers, children born out of wedlock, drug use, child neglect, crime, punishments for crime that do more harm than good to the poor (such as our policies that heap on fines or take away the poors' cars when they get a ticket or fine they can't pay), et al.  

If we want to solve the wealth gap, let's stop playing games, and stop getting distracted with stupid ""hot button"" topics that have a 0.00% chance of solving or impacting the issue.  Let's get real.  We have to better educate ALL people.  We need to incentivize saving rather than screwing the public by promoting a consumerism/materialism culture.  We need to give the power to educate to the professional educators, not corrupt corporate fat cats from testing companies and other industries that have a hand in the educational cookie jar, which are appointed to state boards of education by crooked politicians (I'm looking at you Rick Perry).  We need to call a spade a spade and be blunt about the fact that if you've got 5 kids with 4 women, there is a 0% chance you can/will be an adequate father & role model.  We need to stop jailing every person that breaks the law, b/c all it does is makes it impossible for the poor to take care of their kids and their responsibilities, and make money (and it certainly doesn't help with money making with they get out).  We need to incentivize responsibility, encourage ambition, give people a reason to hope & dream, promote AND teach money management, budgeting, and saving.  We need to stop putting immigrants in a box.  They are our guests, yet we don't treat them as such.  Welcome them, help them, take care of them as you would any guest in your home.  And, we need to stop making this about rich vs poor, and start making this about people.  This is our nation.  We're a family.  We may not always agree, but we are in this together.  It's unconscionable that we have allowed our elected politicians to divide us for THEIR political gain and continued power.  Most of all, I think each and every one of us needs to take a vested interest in our nation.  If you're passionate about helping the poor, then carve out time to mentor at risk youths, participate in free tutoring programs, volunteer for after school programs, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, donate money to camps that help poor kids during the summer, etc.  You're never going to solve poverty.

1)  You only pay taxes on inheritances for which the total value of the estate is more than $5.43M, and only the amount in excess is taxable.  No ""grannie tucker with 30K in savings"" needs to worry about her kids paying taxes on any of what she leaves behind, even if she has an additional $5.4M in other assets.

2) Man, I don't even know if I want to talk to you about wealth taxation because it seems pretty apparent that the strength of your opinion vastly overshadows the strength of your research skills.  We already have something similar to a wealth tax, which we call property tax.  Also I can imagine a world in which IRS agents comb through everyone's finances and people turn into gigantic assholes about the whole thing because that's pretty invasive.  Also also is it not way easier to hide assets than it is to hide income?  How do you handle depreciation/appreciation of assets?  What if I spend half of my income on Beanie Babies, do you value my assets based on what I paid for them or what I can sell them for?  What about study findings that indicate wealth taxes doing things like, you know, discouraging investment, pushing money out of wealth-taxed economies, mucking up tax burdens because of over-complication and differing ideas of how to evaluate value fluctuations, and oh also costing more while bringing in less tax income?       

3) It's true that we have currently have a federal estate tax but no government funding for the cool things the title mentions, but that doesn't mean that cutting an enormous amount of taxes isn't a big deal.  You could also say ""We already have an estate tax, and have no flying cars, so this is bullshit"" or whatever, and it still wouldn't change the fact that our government is grossly underfunded because a significant portion of our population is grossly under-taxed.

You neither mention nor acknowledge the America's Nuclear Umbrella and non-proliferation efforts. Not a small thing for countries like South Korea, Japan, The Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, etc . And those examples are only in East Asia. If you think nuclear arms are the problem and the world would be better off without them... that's chasing Pandora's Box.

When the US *was* in the middle east due to the invasion of Iraq, the region as a whole *was* more stable. The issue at hand is that macro stability required enormous expenditure of blood and treasure, making it inherently unable to endure. The subsequent withdrawal left a massive power vacuum, and with it the crisis that is today.

Overall your comment leaves me a little shocked at the superficial nature of your analysis. Do companies that subside in the military-industrial complex like Halliburton, Raytheon, General Dynamics (and their off-shoot General Atomics), Boeing, United Technologies, and Northrop Grumman profit from conflicts?

[And there are many more](http://www.militaryindustrialcomplex.com/companies.asp). But does that the pork belly profit these companies skim negate the net positive effects US hegemony imposes? Absolutely not. 

This isn't to say there aren't numerous ways to better or ""fix"" the system, of which lies major issues. But to somehow reduce American Hegemony to ""Hur dur companies profit and the people lose, period"" is doing a disservice to yourself and your progressive ideals. I understand that line of thinking is the driving ideological force in the movement, but being dogmatic about it doesn't lead to conversation. If anything it's building an approach to issues that has more in common with Fox News than NPR.

If the Progressive movement can't formulate a lasting foreign policy, instead solely focuses on domestic, then it won't ever become a large enough force for change.

I support moving to single-payer, but I reject this notion that ""healthcare is a right, not a privilege.""  Why should it be a *right*? Medical care requires trained doctors with years and years of education, advanced diagnostic equipment, facilities, R&D, etc. Why on earth would I expect the government to provide all of that to me for free? That doesn't make any sense to me. I have the right to be treated fairly (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) - everything else I need in life is on me, as far as I'm concerned.

The conservative view of healthcare is essentially: we don't want you to lose your health insurance; we just want you to work for it and earn it like ""I"" did.  And conservatives would contend that of course McCain has health insurance - he served his country for decades in the military and in public service. If you want health insurance, get a job. If you already have a job but it doesn't afford you health insurance, then you probably don't work hard enough.

But wait, why do you support single-payer healthcare?  Because it just makes sense. As a people, we would all benefit from it. Some more than others, but all the data and anecdotal evidence suggests that single-payer would benefit the plurality of Americans in many ways with virtually no negatives.  Most importantly; say we have a community of 100 people. 85 have health insurance, and 15 don't. But those 15 people are still able to go to an Emergency Room and be kept from dying at any time. In effect, the 85 are paying for 100, and the 15 are getting a lower quality of care to NOBODY'S benefit. The Obamacare solution was to get all 100 to pay in...or at least closer to it, but to do so in a slightly convoluted way. Single-payer gets us there full-tilt by just using taxes to pay for it. With everyone covered, preventable diseases and such are easier to prevent, lowering overall costs in the long run. *I* personally benefit if *you* have health insurance. Just like education.

That's what we need to be pushing; how the community approach works to everyone's benefit. Not this ""its a right"" nonsense that only pushes conservatives further away.

/edit: as expected, my thoughtful submission amid all the echo-chamber responses gets downvoted. You should be ashamed of yourselves (those that did). I don't care about ""internet points,"" but I would hope more people would at least want to *try* to understand the conservative viewpoint and maybe we could actually begin to make *progress* towards a sensible single-payer solution. Everyone's arguing the ""healthcare is a right"" notion while pointing to other examples of government-provided services. Just because government provides something, doesn't mean it's an inalienable right that you're entitled to. Maybe we're just arguing semantics. One response points out the *right* to an attorney. Yes, of course you have a *right* to an attorney - because government prosecutors have the right to charge you with a crime. And you can't have sufficient due-process of law without trained legal representation.  Roads are not a right. Fire Protection services are not a right. But any state or municipality that cares about it citizens and expects them to move in (and stay) are going to collect taxes for and fund those services because providing for the general welfare of its citizens is good governance. 

Again... I **favor** single-payer. I encourage everyone to talk to neighbors, progressives and conservatives alike, about the benefits of single-payer. Call your representatives - tell them you want it. Argue the merits, explain how everyone benefits from a healthy population - and that it will save them money in the long run.

dkplsst,"> Health care is a right, not a privilege.

May I suggest that we stop saying this – it triggers some people to quibble over [""what makes a basic human right""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/6p8ume/basic_human_right/dknliue/), which derails the conversation with ideological sophistry (and opinion).

Based on the above linked thread, conservatives (or at least Arcons) would seem to agree with this statement (at some level, on its face):

> Dying of cancer gracefully should be a right, not a privilege.

But would disagree with this statement:

> Health care is a right, not a privilege.

Because the latter involves conflicts with their perception that rights are limited to things that do not require any obligation on the part of anyone else: things that you can have, even when stranded and alone on a deserted island.

Instead, I propose saying, ""Healthcare is a critical infrastructure (like roads, water, power, and law enforcement)"" – this short circuits the discussion of ""what is a right?"" (a field chock-and-block full of copy-pasta, feels, weak analogies, and cries of ""educate yourself"") and focuses on the core intent of the argument: that healthcare is something that a civilized society should provide to its members (for both philosophical and pragmatic reasons).",progressive,26,1501012634.0,comment

>Also, I don't believe insurance should be tied to your employer, my employer has no business deciding what options should be available to me.

It's tied to your employer because an employer with 1000 employees can negotiate a better deal than you can on your own.

Employers have added health insurance to their benefits package to attract and retain employees. 

Also employers can survey their own employees and determine which health benefits are most important to them. This might vary significantly for a lot of people especially people across the country, etc.

You want a single payer system which means that single payer decides for literally every single person what their health insurance looks like. This creates zero competition in the market place.

Single payer also does not create any incentive for people to live healthier lifestyles. Americans are the most obese nation in the world. The downstream medical issues associated with obesity is well documented. Other countries with national healthcare do not have the same issues the US has. 

Premiums should be tied to your bmi, exercise level, smoking/drinking level etc. the more risky you are should show up in your insurance premiums. I know this will never happen but this is a major reason universal healthcare is such a difficult issue to figure out. Someone is getting fucked no matter what you do.

I agree that people do this with poor efficacy. I disagree that, properly argued ""access to abortion is a right"" doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 

Bodily autonomy is a right. You can't obligate someone to unwillingly provide life support to a fetus with her body anymore than you can obligate someone to provide life support to another by donating a kidney or part of a liver. 

This is a negative right (i.e. I have a right not to have my bodily autonomy infringed) and the right to bodily autonomy is well established in US case law (see. E.g. McFall v Shimp 10 Pa. D. & C. 3d 90 (July 26, 1978) or Griswold v. Connecticut 381 U.S. 479 (1965).  

although it is not an absolute right (see state interests in strip searches in prison environments); in this case the State would need to articulate why it's interests in violating it on behalf of the being seeking life support are more compelling when the being is an unborn fetus (the abortion case) than when the being is a living citizen (as in the case of bone marrow, liver, or kidney)(established law)

I have not seen a reasonable argument to that.\*

This is all anecdotal theory. Actual data and facts support that universal healthcare leads generally leads to a healthier population. Because people are more motivated to live a healthier lifestyle when its easier and affordable to achieve, with actual medical advice from a doctor that can tell them that their cholesterol is too high, etc. Also, read about peak-child if you haven't already.

Likewise, if Hillary Clinton was at a fashion show, it would be fine to ask her opinion on fashion designers.

It's not a 'turning of the tables', it's a woman being asked a question that a man in her exact same position would *never* be asked. All this proves is that women (the reporter) can fall into the trap of gender stereotyping. It's blatant sexism.

2. Obviously I am not being sarcastic. A male Sec of State would *never* be asked about his preferred fashion designers. I doubt any male outside of the fashion/Hollywood/media industries would ever be asked about their clothing. When was the last time any man in the top ranks of government was asked about his clothing? I will buy you Reddit gold if you can find me a *single* example of a male American politician being asked by a reporter about his clothing.

3. No, it's not relevant at all. Not even a little. Not one tiny iota of relevance. Nobody gives a flying fuck about who designs Hillary Clinton's clothing.

- Those poorest counties are in states with the most total counties. Therefor those counties often have small populations and are rural.

Here are the 10 counties with the highest poverty rates cited from the article. As they mention all of them are in red states... but let us take a look at their representative selection to the house, shall we?

1. [Shannon County, S.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota%27s_at-large_congressional_district) Since the 1980s it has had a steady mix of democratic and republican representatives to congress

2. [Clay County, Ga.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia%27s_2nd_congressional_district) Solid Democratic representation since the 1875

3. [East Carroll Parish, La.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana%27s_5th_congressional_district) - Since 1993 all republican... but from 1878-1993 solid blue.

4. [Sioux County, N.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_County,_North_Dakota) - An Indian reservation...

5. [Todd County, S.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota%27s_at-large_congressional_district) See #1 part of the same congressional district.

6. [Hudspeth County, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas%27s_23rd_congressional_district) Current representative is Republican, back and forth blue red every election cycle for the last 20 years. But from 1963-1993 Solid Democrat

7. [Holmes County, Miss.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi%27s_2nd_congressional_district) Current representative is a Democrat, and with the exception of a few years in the 80s when they tried a republican in this district SOLID DEMOCRAT.


8. Corson County, S.D. See #1 and #5

9. [Wolfe County, Ky.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky%27s_6th_congressional_district) Currently a republican representing in congress, but back and forth between the two parties back to the 1970s, before that take a guess... democrats.

10. Humphreys County, Miss. Same congressional district as #7

>Republicans talk about abolishing the minimum wage...

Meanwhile Democrats sit on their hands and let it devalue over time with inflation. Even $15 an hour proposals (to be implemented over a period of years or even a decade) only amount to an *adjustment* for inflation, not an increase.

>...destroying the EPA and denying climate change...

As far as I can tell, the only good point you've made. I would counter that the EPA doesn't do enough, and can't, as long as the likes of Clinton and other neoliberals in control of the party are sabotaging carbon tax efforts, etc.

>...pushing religious morality...

Irrelevant to free trade.

>...Citizens United decision...

Clinton has said opposing CU will be her litmus test for SCOTUS appointees, which is great, but remains to be seen. Meanwhile, she's benefited more than any other candidate from CU. Her actions don't support her words. It's especially naive to think that these big businesses financing her campaign believe she'll take away their ability to do that.

I said they were both virtually the same on trade with Republicans being slightly more authoritarian. Of the remaining 2, legislating morality is an example of them being more authoritarian, and gun control an example of Democrats being more authoritarian, with a net impact of Republicans being slightly more authoritarian. In short your examples proved my point.

The majority of Democrats do not reject free trade. TPP is Obama and Clinton's bread and butter. After championing it as Secretary of State, Clinton still hasn't outright condemned it, and she's the only candidate from either side who hasn't promised to veto it. Even Trump said he would veto it.

d5pnnao,"In much the same way that $7.25 is the highest it's ever been. In the same way that $5.15 was the highest it ever was ~2000. That's saying nothing for inflation.

According to your own source, sometime around ~1968 it was the highest it's ever been, when about $1.50 was worth nearly $11 adjusted for inflation. Minimum wage rose through the 70s into the 80s while inflation lowered the value of the dollar respective to earlier buying power of the minimum wage. By 1990, minimum wage was $3.80, more than it had been in the 70s, but with less buying power, at about $6.

Minimum wage is increasing, while inflation continues to make it more and more worthless.

Assuming the average inflation rate of 4%, which is a modest average of inflation over the past 25 years, that means that by 2026, $15 will be worth ~$10, so less valuable than the minimum wage in ~1968, and on par with minimum wage through the 70s into the 80s. In other words, this is an *adjustment* for inflation, not an increase.

Furthermore, it will only continue to go down from there. In 5 more years, by 2031, it will be worth as much as today's minimum wage, and you'll be right back where you started, except that Congress will be controlled by the neoliberals you saw fit to put in to power for the hope of a pitiful adjustment to minimum wage, and now that they have what they want from you, they'll have no reason to give you anything else.",progressive,1,1469425611.0,comment

Which remains to be seen and directly contradicts the way she's ran her entire campaign so far.

From your own source 1/3 of Dems support *fast-tracking* TPP, and that's not even including the leadership with Obama and Clinton.

That means 1/3 of Dems support it without even bothering to read it. This says nothing of how many will support it after they read it, except that that number is likely to be much higher.

c4qpuk7,"I'm curious as to what your point is about the donations. That giant corporations fund both major parties? That's absolutely true. And that certainly accounts for some of the big corporate welfare that's gone on during Obama's term, including some real mishandling of the bailout and TARP, and the concessions given to the healthcare industries in democrats' attempt at healthcare reform. And I absolutely agree that this is a serious problem in our political system.

But, and even you mention it yourself - there are huge differences in the way both parties treat social issues, and those differences are stark and far-reaching. One party participated in, endorsed, and encouraged the use of torture, indefinite detention without trial, and other heinous crimes (in either the legal or moral sense) while professing to be a party of family values (but I dunno about you, my family does not condone torture) and morality. The other party did not. One party continues to use oppression tactics to deny basic human rights to huge swaths of the population, with their only argument being essentially religious doctrine, a principle that clearly ignores the separation of church and state espoused in the first amendment of the United States constitution. The other does not, and the de facto leader of that party, the president, just came out in full support of marriage equality to boot. One party explicitly demeans women and denies them basic rights of privacy and control of their own bodies, even to the point where it has threatened lives -- all in the guise of being ""pro-life"". 

Sure, both parties have major, major problems. I am not at all happy with the actions and legislation that has taken place over the last decade or so (since I started paying attention to politics, anyway), and I am certainly not going to sit here and tell you that the democrats are in any way less a vessel for corporate America to infiltrate the government at the expense of the majority of the population.

However, I honestly cannot get behind the idea that the two parties are the same, or that it would be okay to let radical Right-wing conservatives take over and allow these atrocities to continue because it's ""all the same"". It's not, and I will stand by those differences until we are able to fix the wide-reaching problems destroying our political system.",progressive,7,1337638547.0,comment
c4qqfmc,"First point-you can't say the Democrats have ""no balls"" when the Republicans were the first people pushing framing indicating that they ""need to work with both sides"". You can't have it both ways-if the Dems push an agenda, the Republicans would cry ""Exclusion!"" and attempt to martyr themselves as having feasible and sound solutions. Via inclusion, Obama has proven a point that would have only been theory before, and led to critique based on hypothetical situations-Obama included them in the process, and they have done nothing but stonewall every bill he's tried to put forth, while providing none of their own. Despite their buzz word talking point mantra bullshit about ""creating jobs!"", they've only put one bill on the table that I know of to resolve the issue, and if you saw the video, I think we know what their focus has been(hint:It's not about creating those jobs they got all those tax breaks and deregulated a whole bunch of things for). This is my personal beef with the issue-when this conversation comes up, the defense that's always put forth is ""Well, the Dems are doing it too"". Meanwhile, this is coming from the same party that speaks of personal accountability as a solution for most problems-why aren't they exemplifying that?They certainly love to state that as a solution for the poor that are dealing with trying to eke out an existence with no medical care, jobs that are being traded to line the pockets of a few who don't care about using that power to better the system, and a college system that the GOP hasn't given a shit about in years while speaking of ""hard work"" this and ""pull yourself up by your own bootstraps"" that. I can name three issues I have with democrats on the issues, but at least they're not trying to take my rights or my opportunities to self-actualize based on who I am, and if that's the choice other than a person who wants to take off all of the regulatory bodies to supposedly fix things and a party that doesn't consider me human by long standing mantra, I'm voting for Obama, thank you.

\Additional note-I also tend to hear corny defenses of the GOP, that speaks of a glorious past in which ""Martin Luther King was a republican!"", and ""The republicans fought against prejudice!""-that's cute and all, but when there's been several cases that have shown that they don't hold any values of equality for citizens of the US(including Nixon's Southern Strategy, Trent Lott's statements on Strom Thurmond, Strom Thurmond's illegitimate black daughter(funny, no one ever critiqued or stereotyped white people for abandoning their children over that one...?), Larry Craig's ""wide stance"", or a host of others), I don't believe there's a single politician that will fall out of lockstep far enough to break the cycle and redeem the party.

If you can corrupt the company that audits you, you will. In a system where those abuses aren't abuses, you can claim the market regulates itself. But there are public goods that aren't figured into a libertarian world, like clean environment, worker protection, and stockholder protection. Libertarians pretend that all social relations are equal to all business relations, and all business relations are equal. But they are not. We allow limited liability corporations to count as a person, but only with understanding that they do for the public good, and that last part isn't really defined our enforced.

Part of the problem is referring to regulations in terms of quantity instead of quality. When someone a little less knowledgeable talks about ""more regulation"" they don't necessarily mean more unnecessary regulation on smaller businesses that provide a barrier to entry, merely that safeguards should be in place so that the market is less likely to cause tremendously hazardous effects.

c5mnlau,"> Welfare is a response to a problem, not the cause of it.

Correct!  Is it a good response though?  Is it a good solution?  What are the goals of welfare programs?  Do they accomplish those goals?  When one actually investigates the outcomes of some of our social welfare programs we find that it hardly provides much benefit.  However, at the very least we have to give our political leaders some credit that **some** -- albeit a small fraction -- of the money siphoned from the masses does in fact reach the people it is intended to reach.  But this isn't a solution, it creates more problems than solves and creates a sub-culture of people that feel helpless and beholden to those sparse handouts. 

Are you honestly suggesting that social welfare programs are the end all for any social responsibility?  It amazes me that many ""progressives"" feel as though if the government doesn't force the masses to pay then people won't want to be charitable.  

Progressives -- if I could even slump them all into one category -- have a very pessimistic outlook on human ingenuity and progress, which is humorous to say the least.

Furthermore, your condescending attitude is stereotypical in this subreddit and it doesn't promote thought provoking discussion in the slightest.

But downvote me for stating the obvious, that these social welfare programs are a haphazard solution to a problem that is getting worse as our national debt increases.  We reap what we sow.",progressive,-21,1343843365.0,comment

c5motjd,"I used to be one of the ""assholes"" that you speak of.  Really.  I was in my 30's, doing well, married, two young children, all of us in prefect health and me with a job that was a guarantee to get to ""six figure"" territory and stay there for as far as I could see.  I saw my life as living proof that as long as one works hard and plays by the rules, one will get ahead eventually, even with disappointments and detours along the way.  The poor were simply people who made stupid decisions and/or lacked the moral backbone to do the right thing.  I'd be the guy applauding Romney's remarks about culture bringing fortune and providence.  

Then a funny thing happened.  The industrial market that was my bread & butter stated to dry up after NAFTA and other trade agreements were in place.  My savings began to evaporate after deregulation ruined banking for guys like me. In the space of less than one year, I was out of a job, my wife was diagnosed with cancer, and I too was eventually hospitalized for what could have been a terminal illness.  (Fast forward to today, we're all okay) 

Who helped my family out of this mess?  Was it ""Big Business""?  Nope.  Was it ""Big Government""?  Yes.  

Our local town gave us relief from our taxes, free lunch for our kids at school along with no fees for any extracurricular activities, I got unemployment checks from the federal/state government, help with finding a new job, and we were on Medicaid. There was more, but you get the drift.  This all lasted less than six months but without it, we would have lost our home and all that we had worked for.  

I stated working when I was 16.  All this shit hit the fan when I was 46.  So basically, I paid into the system for 30 years and then I needed to take out for 6 months.  And then I've have another 20 years to pay in before I can retire, and that's fine with me.  That's how a civil society should work.  

It took me a while but I finally got clean from the ""pre-packaged poison"", stopped listening to Talk Radio, turned off Fox News, and began to read.  I spoke with friends who live in Canada, Denmark, France and saw that they actually had it much better than I did, even with all my ""freedom"".

Social mobility and personal productivity have not been crippled by the welfare states of the Old World.  To the contrary, it is here with our delusions about the merits of cutthroat competition that human potentials are squandered on an industrial scale.

c5mpi01,"Though that resource you linked to was from 2003, it looks like the overall level of homelessness in Europe, a continent containing more than twice the population of the United states, is ~3 million.  The problem is especially bad in parts of Eastern Europe where public policy does not aggressively address the issue as well as Italy and Greece, where social services cannot keep up with refugees and immigrants.  

In England, with a population of 53 million, the number of homeless individuals can be measured in the hundreds.  There the state is required to provide assistance to homeless residents as well as people on the brink of losing their homes.  Sweden, Norway, Finland, Holland, Switzerland, Austria . . . the list goes on of nations that actually have reduced homelessness to levels as low as practical measures can.  Meanwhile the United States has over 1.5 million homeless children.   You are part of the problem by raising your voice to obstruct action to resolve a problem that is well within the means of this nation to address.  Yet you probably still think you are upholding noble principles rather than monstrously perpetuating horrors sure to result in lifelong disadvantages for many of that legion of unsheltered youth.

Regarding taxation, again, no one is forcing you to make money.  You really do have a choice not to pay taxes.  You instead make a choice to participate in the mainstream economy.  I'll type very slowly now so you can follow along.  **You make a choice to earn dollars.  You make a choice to buy and sell goods and services in the mainstream economy.  Not one person forces you to do these things.**  Therefore, when the time comes to pay taxes on your income, the obligation is one you incurred by entirely voluntary action.  The argument that big bad ol' guv'm'nt points guns at people to force them to pay taxes is predicated on the notion that you have some sort of God-given right to the benefits of the system you refuse to acknowledge as legitimate.  If you don't like it, stop participating.  If you do like it, stop being a disgusting little bitch when the time comes to pay your share of the upkeep on that system.  How anyone over the age of ten sees this as unfair, never mind a brutal breech of some sort of principle, is mystifying.

Don't get me wrong, the guy has some great ideas and may be morally against some of the things he's signed into law.  In practice, however, he's too busy continuing the policies and practices of the previous administration to make any considerable progress.

And in the end, I don't really give a shit what he _says_ he's going to do, the laws he's signed into existence say otherwise.

Of course, that's not even touching the state of Congress, the plutocracy, or everything else that's wrong with the legislative branch, but in a sense, nothing has changed.  

Globally, the guy's center-right.  I still voted for him, as the alternative wasn't any better, but I'm perpetually saddened by the fact that the best we can do is ""Well, he's better than the other guy!""

But there is a huge difference between deliberately targeting an American citizen and an American citizen who was traveling with known terrorists being killed in an Air Strike. 

For you to believe that they targeted Abdulrahman you have to believe that they would waste a few hundred thousand dollars targeting a 16 year old with no skills or importance rather than the operational leader of Al Qaida who he was traveling near.

c9as2m1,"> Obama extends Patriot Act without reform

After receiving President's Daily Intelligence Briefings, the POTUS has realized where actionable intelligence comes from...the places people think they're ""safe from collection"".

> Signs NDAA 2011 (and 2012, and 2013) 

We sign a National Defense Authorization Act every year...it's funding for the DoD. It's not really negotiable as our defense spending goes to more than just the American military and MI complex; it pays for strategic defense for our allies as well.

> Appeals the Federal Court decision that “indefinite detention” is unconstitutional

Because indefinite detention of terror suspects who must be tried or punished with classifed evidence is a necessity. Declassifying the evidence would reveal sources and methods that would place informants in harm, reduce the capability to elicit more sources, and sacrifice a technological advantage.

> Double-taps a 16-year-old American-born US citizen living in Yemen, weeks after the boy's father was killed. Administration's rationale?

Your wording is deceptive. Awlaki's son wasn't the intended target of the strike, his friend Ibrahim al Banna was the intended target. Palling around with terrorists in the middle of nowhere is suspect though...

> Waives sections of a law meant to prevent the recruitment of child soldiers in Africa in order to deepen military relationship with countries that have poor human rights records 

And what is the alternative? Waive the only substantial means of diplomacy with African nations so as to allow China to expand its sphere of influence in the most important resource grab of the 21st Century?

> DOJ raids marijuana dispensaries that are now legal pursuant state law 

Thanks to Civil Rights agitation for the better part of the last 70 years, state laws are meaningless and can be trumped by Federal fiat. I don't know how else to say this but...this is blowback, cupcake.

> Renews FISA and NSA’s unregulated spying and banking of all wireless communication 

You *want* FISA, because the alternative is the policies from the 1960s and 70s that were used to harass domestic political groups. FISA thoroughly limits the amount of collection on US persons (citizens, residents, corporations) at home and abroad.

> DOJ overzealously prosecutes [read: persecutes] activist Aaron Swartz, ultimately leading to his suicide in the face of trumped-up charges brought forth to silence his movement for open information 

The only person responsible for killing Aaron Swartz is Aaron Swartz. That's a fact. Don't dispute fact, it makes you look like a creationist.

> Obama nominates JP Morgan defense lawyer to head the SEC, the regulatory agency in charge of keeping Wall Street in line 

Because putting people in charge of the SEC with no inside knowledge of the industry and its practices has worked so well? Financial regulation is a cat and mouse game, you need to poach talent from the mice so that the cat can stay up to date.

> Picks Goldman Sachs partner Bruce Heyman—who, along with his wife, raised $1 million for Obama—as an ambassador to Canada

Saying that kind of stuff really shows how little one knows about how our government works. The president himself does not just choose every single law that goes into effect. Congress is really where most of the lawmaking occurs, and the president really only has the final signature or veto.

The problem with saying ""Oh, Obama should just veto the bad laws then!"" is that the GOP will then use the fact that he vetoed a law to paint him as some sort of blocker of progress; we all know that. Most of the time, if something is popular enough to make it through our VERY divided house, the president's best bet is to just let the law pass.

In reality, if the president was allowed to make all the legislation by himself, with the help of his cabinet, completely bypassing congress, this country would be better off. Maybe not PERFECT, but better.

Unless his record changes, he won't rouse any support for the party's real positions in 2014.  Even if he managed to get anything done in his last two years, it would only come (given the House makeup) with massive concessions to the ultra wealthy, who have had it way too good for far too long in this country.  

Most of the 1%ers I know are fine with paying higher taxes anyway, because they know the scale needs to tilt the other way.  There are some who will piss and moan about it when the new tax bill comes, but it isn't going to change their lifestyles and there are enough reasonable ones among them who know it has to be done.  

And then there are the selfish a-holes who don't want to pay a nickel more, but why are we letting them drive our taxation policy again?

Um, no, try again.  There's a brit in Gitmo whose been there 11 years. The UK want him to return home but the US will only send him to Saudi Arabia.

He has been cleared for release by the US authorities but has yet to be freed as the Americans have insisted on returning him to Saudi Arabia. Although he holds Saudi nationality with his British residency, Aamer’s wife and four children – one of whom he has never met – live in London. The British government are supportive of him returning to the UK but the Americans have so far refused to hand him over.
“But our response to that is they’re not enforcing any law because Shaker has not broken any law, he’s not been prosecuted for breaking any law and they’re not investigating him for breaking any law. So our position is they would have no such privilege.”

>We sign a National Defense Authorization Act every year...it's funding for the DoD. It's not really negotiable as our defense spending goes to more than just the American military and MI complex; it pays for strategic defense for our allies as well.

Sounds like you're advocating complete totalitarianism. We should be really scared, right? So scared that we agree to allow the government to try people in secret, with no evidence, imprison anyone and not ask too many questions. For safety.

I think the civil rights issue here is not the infringement on states' rights but rather the infringement on pot smokers' rights. Too often opponents of the drug war oppose it purely on pragmatic reasons: it is ineffective, costly, a plague on the African-American community, and a giant boon to Mexican ganglords.

The alternative is to learn from our mistakes. Being the bad guy while hoping the public will somehow conclude we're really the GOOD guy didn't work before, and it won't work now. I dunno — maybe we should try to be the good guy in the hope that they'll see us as the good guy?

>>Thanks to Civil Rights agitation for the better part of the last 70 years, state laws are meaningless and can be trumped by Federal fiat.

Really? Blaming creeping federalism on the negro? Wow. 

No, creeping federalism is the result of a politically conservative judiciary's expansive interpretations of the Commerce Clause, coupled with its commitment to the ""legislative deference"" doctrine which is simply an unwillingness to let the judiciary function as designed — that is, a co-equal branch MEANT to check legislative excesses.

>>You want FISA, because the alternative is the policies from the 1960s and 70s that were used to harass domestic political groups. FISA thoroughly limits the amount of collection on US persons (citizens, residents, corporations) at home and abroad.

FISA is a secret court, meaning it's unconstitutional. Fact is, you can only BELIEVE that FISA ""thoroughly limits the amount of collection"" because you cannot actually KNOW or LEARN what FISA is doing — *because it operates in secret.*

Oh, well if your Russian friend was mad, then I guess you have to do what she said.

Or maybe you can vote rationally regardless of what other irrational people tell you. Even if a third-party doesn't win, if a large percentage of the liberal voters all switched to third party and that caused the Democratic candidate to lose, that would be a pretty clear message to the Democratic party that they need to field better candidates if they want to win. If you vote for a Democratic candidate for no other reason than because they're better than the Republican candidate, then they get the message that all they need to do to win the election is be just slightly better than the Republicans. And with the GOP going down the crazy-hole, that's going to lead to some really crappy candidates.

You're not having intelligence professionals grant warrants, you're having judges who have served elsewhere in the justice system grant warrants under the premise that what comes before them is a state secret. If they can review probable cause in one place, they can do it in another. Prior to FISA, the intelligence agencies didn't have to even ask for a warrant....they just spied on 'troublemakers' because they were asked to.

Libertarians resent these political games; George Bush got grilled by the libertarian community unrelentingly. How do you expect libertarian outcry when 1) you weren't interested in hearing it, and 2) there are so few libertarians out there, and the media actually blacks them out?

Here's a video of Ron Paul during George Bush's tenure in Congress, lambasting Bush's militarism: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZmPS0XmeBw Here is Ron Paul voting with predominantly Democrats to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell: http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/638.

I am too lazy to look up videos of Ron Paul from long time ago (they're annoying to filter in YouTube), but go ahead and find tons of examples of Ron Paul (who was a Republican at this time) completely shitting on everything in the Bush Administration. 

Rand Paul wasn't even in office during Bush's tenure, so you can't really cite him. He's the closest there is to a libertarian in Congress right now, but he's still a decent ways off from someone like his father (who was the Libertarian Party candidate for President back in the 80s, and even criticized Reagan for being too big government). In other words, he's a conservative-libertarian, not a full-fledged libertarian. And guess what, even libertarians are upset that he's not libertarian enough.  But to say that he's completely fake is also bullshit: He's firmly against NDAA, Patriot Act, DOMA, and the list goes on. His voting record is consistent with a large portion of libertarian philosophy; he dislikes government intrusion in economic AND social affairs. Liberals don't give a shit about civil liberties, except on the rare occasion that it has to do with gay people. Conservatives don't give a shit about civil liberties *at all*.

These voters generally refuse to vote anything but Republican based on their social views, despite the current conservative/GOP policies favoring ~~the super wealthy~~ the investor class and throwing the middle class and below under the bus economically speaking.

>Liberals don't give a shit about civil liberties, except on the rare occasion that it has to do with gay people.

It's hard for me to articulate how exactly wrong this is. I think you may just be uneducated on what liberalism is -- which is not a unique condition given the hijacking of the word by the Right. 

Basic, fundamental liberal causes include: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of (and from) religion, due process, right to trial, the prevention of indefinite detention, freedom of conscience, freedom of women's rights, freedom of gay rights, freedom of assembly. Liberals also tend to believe that torture and the death penalty violate civil liberties, and that hawkish foreign policy is often not compatible with others' civil liberties. 

These things are implicit in the definition of liberalism. Yes, they believe in basic government services, social programs, and progressive income taxes, but those things are not antithetical to civil liberties. I have no idea how you could come to the conclusion that the liberal view on civil liberties can be reduced to ""we're OK with the gays.""",progressive,1,1365438474.0,comment

As you can see, I disagreed (and continue to disagree) that libertarians are ""the only ones this watchful over civil liberties violations,"" which is not really a matter of introspection as much as it is ideological prerogative.

Your links all appear to be about libertarians who don't like Rand Paul. I wouldn't either if I were libertarian. He is, as I said in my comment a month ago, a ""fake rebranded-Republican"" libertarian, not particularly emblematic of the values espoused by the current libertarians party (as I understand it). This isn't a True Scotsman thing; the Republican brand has been tarnished, and the word libertarian has become more palatable to old-school small-government former-Republicans.
 
It would be trivially easy to search this very subreddit (which I do not subscribe to, incidentally) for the term ""Obama"" and find reams of progressives who are critical against his policy (if you consider him left-of-center). I don't find it particularly interesting to debate which party is most self-critical (here ignoring the distinction between libertarian ideology and the libertarian party, as well as progressive ideology and the far-left side of the democratic party). We would almost certainly not agree with one anther's conclusions, and I'm quite content with that.
 
But for what it's worth: Democrats have never been good at messaging, and I think that's because the party represents a greater plurality of views than the sharply-branded Republicans -- who profess to stand for family, defense, smaller government, state's rights, etc. What does ""Democrat"" stand for? It's a harder question to answer, even for Democrats. The messaging on the right is far more consistent, from media talking heads to politicians to card-carrying citizens. That's why ""liberal"" is used like a pejorative and ""conservative"" is used like flag. Conservatives have had a stronger influence over the verbiage used in political debate. They have owned the language. That's why they've been over-represented (proportionately to the populace) for the past several decades. There's a wider gradient of views implicit in the left--and absolutely a tremendous amount of self-criticism and debate.

The democrat party nominated John Kerry the next round (the only time the democrats lost the popular vote to the republicans since 1992).

The game theory argument is interesting but has a few flaws. It is notoriously difficult to achieve the optimal solution in Game theory, and the current electoral college system is rigged against it (I would prefer a system that split states EC votes by their popular vote outcome) . It is basically impossible for a third party candidate to get any EC votes. The best they can hope to achieve is a significant percentage of the popular vote, which is why I vote third party when in a decided state, but not in a swing state where my vote is more valuable in deciding the EC vote.

Democracy stems from the words ""demos"" (common people) and ""kratic"" (rule/power).

This was at a time of kings, queens and emperors. Even by electing a representative that acts on your behalf makes you a democracy, as your elected representative is, by it's original meaning, a ""common person"".

You could argue that all the elected representatives in the US are rich as fuck, and therefore not common at all. However there's nothing actually stopping common people from running or being elected, it's just Americans *vote* for the ruling class every time instead of the common people.

All a republic means is that you don't have a king or queen as your head of state. Most countries are republics these days. Ireland for example.

So yeah, I'd probably do a little research into what words mean and think about their meaning before saying stuff like that. America is a democracy, but not a *direct* democracy.

For four years, you now have a slightly worse president (if you think Romney and Obama were really all that different, you got caught up in [the two-party swindle](http://lesswrong.com/lw/mg/the_twoparty_swindle/)), but the Democratic party learns the lesson that they have to actually field a halfway decent candidate in order to win the election.

Right now the current-day definition of ""economically liberal"" would most likely be deemed at the very least moderate-right on a not-skewed spectrum of right and left wing policy. But because there's bullshit like the Grover-Norquist tax pledge (conservatives all signing a friendship promise to not raise taxes under any circumstances) and obstructionist shitheads in Congress refusing to negotiate at all, it's complete shifted the scale. Obama then compounded this issue by trying to negotiate a reasonable distance from the asshole conservatives (not saying all of the GOP guys are awful, just unfortunately those with the loudest voices/most power) as opposed to a truly economically liberal stance. To illustrate it simply, imagine as if the neutral, un-fucked scale was 0 to 10, with 0 being the staunchest conservative and 10 being the most liberal. Ideally, Obama would negotiate from somewhere in the 9 range, Boehner and co. from the 2 range, and accounting for the Democratic position of power, they'd eventually come to something around a 6. The problem is, the current state of the GOP is at somewhere around a batshit -4, but Obama kept the same damn 7 point gap and started his negotiations from 3. So now, Chained CPI and other Social Security fuckery is not only on the table (something which would never be included in the past), but even being offered by Obama. Ironically, and thankfully, the far-right has Boehner's balls in a vice grip that he won't even accept that proposal. 

So basically, until the Democrats grow some balls, and until the GOP gets the fucking morons out of office and replaces them with politicians who won't shut down the government out of spite and spend millions upon billions of dollars lobbying against no-brainer policies that shouldn't even be debated (the existence of climate change, corporate reform, gay marriage and abortion to name a few), this spectrum is going to keep shifting further and further to the right to the detriment of everybody as it's destroying the very concept of governmental balance.

I would argue even then not. People were just as if not more busy, and access to information was lesser than today courtesy of the internet. It is true politics played a much greater role in day-to-day life, in particular during the mid-to-late 19th century, but this was often a more single issue thing, and varied. In a territory, *of course* politics was of import, but the politics of import were questions of whether you wanted to become a state or split into multiples (The Dakota Territory & mountainous west deliberately split up into more territories/states to give greater Republican representation in Congress and the electoral college) or become independent. If you were a woman, you fought for the right to vote. Politics was much more sectional and factional back in the day, but became increasingly homogenized in terms of the parties starting with the 1850s but moreso come the 1890s/1900s. When parties were less uniform, it became necessary to educate yourself who advocated what if you wanted to see your politics in government. A Democrat in Georgia was radically different from a Democrat in New York, and a Republican from Pennsylvania was different from a Republican in California. As the parties have become more uniform, you can expect (though not know for certain) that a Democrat supports abortion rights and a Republican opposes them, or whatever issue you wish to use as an example, and vote accordingly.",progressive,1,1365458355.0,comment

Only if you have experts whose analysis you can trust, or access to objective data from sources you can trust and the intelectual wherewithal to do a preliminary analysis yourself.

Here you're acknowledging that irrationality, specifically compassion in this case, plays a role is pickign a side on social issues.  What also should be acknowledged is the extent to which irrational biases also impact issues like economics.  Many people react to the complexity of such issues by relying of snap judgements and gut instinct (i.e. irrational subconscious biases) rather than applying much thought to the matter.  Precsiely because in depth thought takes time and effort to formulate.

It's that lack of competitiveness in elections which really concerns me.  Most elections don't provide the electorate with a real choice.  Congressional elections are a particularly good (or, rather, bad) example of this.  Our winner takes all electoral system breeds a two party dynamic which artificailly narrows the choices voters get, and thanks to jerrymandering most House elections aren't even remotely competitive between the parties.

Which version of history?  History isn't some static absolute you can prove in a lab like the laws of thermodynamics.  It's open to interpretation and revision.  One of the biggest problems we have in America today is that basic questions of our history like, ""Were we founded as a christian nation?"" and ""What caused the civil war?"" are under dispute in the public sphere.  As a result we are arguing over who we are as a nation and not just what our policies should be.

It's not laziness, it's confusion and ignorance.  People hear arguments coming from all sides and don't know what to believe.  People need to be taught.  People need to be lead.  

>They wait until 3 months before the Presidential election, vote their party, and cry 2 years later when nothing gets done.

Wow, 3 months is actually pretty good.  Most studies show that the majority of voters don't start paying close attention to elections until two weeks from the election date.

>these same people don't put in an ounce of effort or some minimal critical thinking when it comes to politics

Critical thinking doesn't come naturally, it has to be taught, and most people aren't taught it in our society.  You wouldn't expect someone to drive a car if they've never had driving lessons would you?  Real critical thinking is a skill that has to be learned and practiced before people will be any good at it.  And even with practice, most people are bad at it.  Like I said, it doesn't come naturally.

>They say they participated but that is also bullshit. None of them take part in local elections. None of them take part in Congressional elections. I bet most Americans couldn't even name their District Representative.

Our school civics classes are shit.  Most people aren't taught what real political participation means and entails.  I was lucky, my parents were politcally engaged and taught me to be as well.  I'd bet someone, at some point, taught you.  Most people in America haven't had the benefit of that.  They think voting for President is the best they can do, becasue no one taught them better.

He has executed an American Citizen before they've been given a trial.  Habeus Corpus? WTF is that?  He has executed an innocent American Citizen who just happened to be the son of another American Citizen suspected of being an anti-american terrorist.

Success story from the early 1990s in Oregon revealed people who had been fishing salmon for generations, but the stocks were pretty much depleted. The state assisted these people with training in a different trade. The trade happened to be sheep ranchers. Not only were these people able to make the transition relatively easily, they experienced profits beyond anything ever recorded through generations of fishing as well as contributing to the state GDP. Oh, and some had to move because their location wasn't conducive to sheep ranching. They also did well enough that they held exchanges with sheep ranchers in New Zealand, a place they likely didn't know existed and never expected to visit.

d6cxhjc,"A great number of them are in it for the legacy.  I was born and raised in Central West Virginia, and i can tell you that the mines are glorified by just about everyone in the area.  The kids are either duped into it because, ""That's what we've done since your great-great-great grandaddy settled here."", or they are basically neglected children whose parents didn't pay enough attention to their education and burgeoning criminal record to set them up to succeed in the greater world.  There is also the ""promise"" of the money.  

My hometown, Richwood, was pretty much destroyed by flooding a month ago, and i went in to see if i could lend a hand.  My last night in town, my brother and I went out for a beer, and i talked to moner that had been making almost 100,000 a year. Granted, it was because of insane amounts of overtime, but there it was, all the same.  

Coal is dying, and you can't blame Obama, or the EPA. It's fracking, it's Wyoming mining 3x as much coal for .25% of the labor than all of what us pulled out of Appalachia. It's climate change and rhe realization that we cannot keep on with business as usual.  

Growing up there, i have no problems with the miners.  It's the coal companies that deserve yo be vilified.  The MO goes something like this.  Mine as much coal as you can, at whatever expense to the prople, the land, and the economy that you can.  When it's no longer profitable, liquidate, devlare bankruptcy AFTER you've handed out tens of millions in bonuses to the executives, declare the pension plan i solvent  and leave the rubes to clean up your mess.  

If these people would use their heads, there's an entire, untapped industry just waiting in commercial and industrial hemp.  It sounds like stoner logic, but it is probably the most versatile plant that we have.  Textiles, chemicals, health and beauty aides, building materials, the list is endless.

But it's also hard to move. I live in LA, and in all likelihood I will never be a homeowner because all the homes within a reasonable driving distance for where my industry is are ridiculously expensive. So, if you lived in some beautiful backwoods coal town in a four bedroom mansion, and some city-people are trying to tell you it's in your own interest to move to a nasty city where you have to work longer hours to afford a 1-bedroom but you might have a chance at something better if you work REALLY hard... You might try to stick it out too.

And I still hate this idea that everyone has to innovate or die. I'm not saying we need to give massive handouts to rural folks, but the rural/urban divide in this country is causing some real dissonance. State boundaries are obsolete.

Like the property tax scheme here is that your rate gets grandfathered in meaning, if I inherit my family's mansion in Beverly hills I could be paying lower property taxes than some newly-wed couple who managed to score a 1-bedroom bungalow in Compton. This makes the rest of us have to compensate with higher general taxes because most money is old money.

The rural folks think they rely on this scheme because they often inherit their land and thus their reps will fight tooth and nail to keep it, when the reality is, this is why their state taxes are so high. If there was governance that allowed for different schemes based on urban and rural areas instead of just state lines, both sides could stop ruining each others systems so the whole thing runs poorly.

My point is, you should have sympathy for these people because they have good reasons to believe the way they do even if it's factually wrong, and they have less power/representation/money as the urban centers become more populated and their areas become less.

codv2cm,"There's a ton of reasons you wind up seeing that. Sometimes they're posting it like that so they can convince their internal hr that they should go through the trouble of sponsoring someone. Sometimes it is a manager that blew the budget early on in a project or had something go really wrong and now he has to try to find extra help without enough money to actually get it. 

It all depends, but there's usually a story that I can suss out from a ten minute conversation with the manager on a certain job when their price is ridiculously low. Sometimes I can convince them that they know they're not near the market rate and get them to be reasonable. Sometimes it really is just the best they can do and they're hoping to get someone.

I can say, with unemployment so low right now, gone are the days when they can open a req and get a bunch of resumes to leisurely look over and get back to you when they want. It hasn't tightened up that much yet, but it will, and that's when you'll see start to be a little more reasonable.

If you're an engineer with ten years of java the rate varies depending on the particular flavor of java skills that you have. If you're an early adopter of the angular.js framework, you can get a great rate, anywhere from $70 per hour all the way up to $90-100 depending on the location and client. The 90-100 range I don't see often, but it happens and I know people are out there getting those jobs. If you're more vanilla flavors of java I see it anywhere from 60-80ish or even more depending on where you live. 

It all depends. The trick is to pick a recruiter that you trust and just stick with them. It's hard to find one that you trust, because there are a lot of shit heads in my industry. But, there are some good ones out there that want to have a long term working relationship with you and make sure you make as much money as you are worth while earning a respectable margin on the deal. They might be able to get you a little more or a little less at each job, but you get the drift. 

The best recruiting firms try to make everyone come away from the deal happy including the contractor, the client, and themselves. It's always great when a client calls back and asks if a certain engineer is free and can we arrange for them to come back for a while.",progressive,1,1423287676.0,comment

The GOP is the same party that successfully attacked a decorated war hero and questioned both this patriotism and even his military record.  They also were able to paint this image that he was some elitist snob.  All while he was running against a rich Republican frat-boy that used his daddy's connections to lay low in the Texas  while Vietnam was going on.  

This is the same party that has been able to get poor Southern whites to vote them in, all while almost all the party's policies run directly counter to what is best for those people.  The fact that Sander's policies get favorable reviews from Republicans is completely immaterial.  The same thing has been going on with Obamacare for years now - the majority of Republican voters support it when they aren't told its Obamacare.  The second they are told that, they immediately sour on the plan.  

Lastly, this is the same party that has successfully changed the image of Jesus as being some kind of wacko NRA, gun-toting right-winger with blonde hair and blue eyes.

They both have a strong focus on equality (income, lgbt, racial, gender, etc.) They both have the right ideas for healthcare and education as well.  I'd be perfectly fine with either candidate. In fact, I think they're both great candidates.

I actually agree with Sanders on more topics, but feel like Clinton could get a lot more of what I want done. Yes, Sanders is an ""outsider"" but being an outsider doesn't help you get shit done, especially when we have an absurdly obstructionist opposing party.
I see it this way... I agree with Sanders on like 95% of topics, Clinton on 90% of topics, but I feel that with her clout and her connections, she's going to get 60% of what she wants done whereas Sanders is only likely to get about 50% of what he wants done.

The vast majority (which does not mean 100%) of people that know anything about Bernie Sanders, including those that disagree with his policies, agree that he is an honest, genuine person of abnormal integrity for a politician, and this explains why many republicans have voted for him, despite their disagreement of his stance on the issues, over the years.",progressive,2,1443208858.0,comment

You came here because you expected these responses and Reddit is full of delusional progressives who haven't examined the issue enough. It was MY comment and I expect it will be downvoted to hell and rightfully so. I was using the Ted Nugent Technique for Proper Discourse though usually you just call them queer, fairy, unAmerican thug terrorists.  Donald Trump excels at this. I learned to avoid as a freshman in college but the juvenile in me sometimes like to make less than thoughtful comments. I don't represent Reddit or r/progressive and not should I.  

Now, to why these people are not innocent trespassers who aren't harming us. To start, it continues to escalate and accelerate a dangerous precedence that was set after Ruby Ridge.  The U.S. government refuses to deal properly with right wing organizations (there are token enforcement examples at best- ""Look, we arrested these militia members we thought had progress beyond the theoretical stage"").  If you can see the difference in treatments both currently and traditionally based on gender, race, sexual orientation, creed, political orientation and religion. If these were not white right wing Christian militia members, the FBI would have ended this and would forcefully removed them to a jail cell to await trumped charges and enhance interrogation. The evidence is overwhelming both historically and at the present time. We have seen brutal treatment to the Occupy, Immigration, Anarchist, LGBT, Black Lives Matter, Nativist (those who originally claimed the land), and Environmentalist Movements. They pepper sprayed them, they beat them back with batons, they launch gas canisters without regard to those with sensitive health situations, they have thrown people and dragged them to transportation vehicles. They have even gone as far as to shoot people who threatened them in slightest manner. This is not the exception, this is the norm. Intimidate, main, interrogate, and even kill. These militia members are just becoming embolden with their intentions. They are holding us hostage with demands. The next group will be even crazier and brazen in their efforts to circumvent our laws. 

On a practical side, the people of Burns have cancelled school and rearranged their whole lives because these guys believe that two criminals (they are actually criminals, duly convicted in our judicial system) be released without serving their federally mandate minimum sentence.  They are trying to intimidate us to their own ends. 

I personally can't stand the ""this is what I expected argument "" I know I have prejudices but I don't need to go to r/progun, r/Republicans, r/conservatives or r/libertarians to point it out. I don't post there because their views unlike mine are already cemented. You're welcome to stay around and try to convince us that we are wrong but we didn't just randomly pick sides on issues but rather base our positions on the best available information available. Sometimes, I'm wrong and data becomes clear that my thoughts are incorrect.  This isn't one of those situations. Once again, I apologize for my juvenile comment and hope you will come back for actual debate.

You've described the weapons that account for statistically almost all shootings in the US.

Handguns, by far, are in the lead, at around 80%. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/sunday-review/the-assault-weapon-myth.html?_r=0

As per the article's writing, only 300 people, total, were murdered by rifles. 

> (AR 15 and similar guns that most sane people don't carry on a regular basis).

Autoloading pistols, or revolvers with moon clips are perfectly capable of being used in a mass shooting. Virginia Tech was carnage committed solely by handguns: a Glock, and a .22 LR Walther pistol. Both Ft. Hood mass shootings, as well, with the higher-profile one including a Smith & Wesson .357 revolver, technology that out-dates all living Americans. Breivik, who perpetrated the worst mass shooting of all time, also used a Glock pistol. 

All that matters is how rapidly the action can cycle, and how many joules the projectile fired will impact with.

cyw2uw4,"The fact that they have not been declared terrorists has nothing to do with the color of their skin from an administrative level (though it does factor in indirectly).  It has everything to do with the fact that there are several HUNDRED armed militiamen, who cannot be easily be apprehended without a total slaughter.  I can't find hard numbers with a quick search, Except for the number 300 in the early days back when it was just protests.  I'll assume that the number is the same now (though i suspect it is probably higher at this point as several other militias have joined).  

300 people that are well armed.  Short of a drone strike, there's no way to actually take these militiamen in without massive casualties on both sides.  Killing 300+ American citizens is not something that is palatable to most Americans, nor would it play well on the news.  

Which brings us to our second problem:

A display like that would make the net problem worse, not better.  By eliminating one militia with such tactics, you end up creating 100 more, and simultaneously enhancing support for the existing militias, some of whom would probably see the siege as an act of war.  

Civil war is bad.  Right now this occupation is illegal, and stupid (IMO) but this isn't a major highway.  It's not a school.  It's not a hospital.  No one is dying by their occupation, and sooner or later they're going to run out of ""snacks"" and give up, at which point many will be arrested.

These sorts of people exist everywhere, but their numbers are limited. Look at the far-right racist parties in Europe. Whether it's the Front National or Jobbik, their support rarely (if ever) tops 20%. You're just not going to get to the mainstream by appealing solely to the base desires of a (in the grand scheme) small number of people. 

Trump might be the flavor of the week, but he knows he's just getting press by catering to the authoritarian-follower types. The media will get sick of it, and he'll flame out.

Dammit. Despite the: [70 years in which Detroit has been hemorrhaging citizens](http://i.imgur.com/hNVqb76.jpg), the economic and racial segregation of new suburbs forcing the population into ever shittier and poorer living conditions, the resulting urban decay and blight after decades of neglect and low tax incomes due to the disproportionate amount of poor people, the increase in gangs due to the resulting abandonment of structures, underfunded police departments and schools, the resulting fractured families, the resulting unemployment. All of these things spanning the course of decades which often feed back into each other creating the viscous cycle that is life for poor, predominately black, people in in Detroit. Out of all those things, the one thing that catches your attention as the ""**root** of the issue"" is the color of people's skin.

gotcha bitch, you said it yourself ""the resulting"" decay, it happened after white people left, and the reason white people left was due to safety.

and all that nonsense you brought up happened after, *after*, so the cause of white flight was the mass of under-educated, ignorant, and usually violent african-americans in detroit at the time caused white flight, that's the root of the issue.

quit trying to guilt white people into living around ignorant black people. guilt ignorant black people into not being ignorant.

edit: also drugs, drugs were a huge part of the culture of ignorance, and violence in the black communities, the drugs caused a complete breakdown of the black culture in detroit at the time, instead of staying in school, kids dropped out, and did/sold drugs, nobody put the drugs in those peoples/kids hands and forced them to do them, or forced them to sell them, they all did that willingly, that's not white peoples' fault. and you are wrong if you suggest that it is.",progressive,0,1437199137.0,comment

cee3ts3,"As a libertarian, this is totally non-convincing. The author simply states his position without making his case at all.

The USA is not a libertarian paradise, although it does have some features that are attractive (constitutionalism, judicial review, enumerated individual rights) these features are prized by the entire political spectrum in the US. Furthermore, there are other features of American democracy that libertarians especially regret: unfettered power of majority, legislation favoring big business over small business, poor monetary policy and banking policy...

I am not really sure what the author means when he says that libertarians cannot be called pro-liberty if they oppose increased regulation of the activities of businessmen. We are not in general pro-liberty if that means political liberty (ex: right to vote) except as a means to an end. The end libertarianism pursues is individual liberty - the freedom to choose one's own activities and life without government interference. There are necessary and wise limits to this liberty, most obviously the prohibition on violence, effected through the criminal code, police, and penal system. Nonetheless, the goal of a libertarian is to increase as much as possible this personal freedom, this private sphere of individual self-determination. So much as is possible, both the richest and poorest should have freedom to determine the course of their own lives.

A few objections might be made here, the most common of which is that the extreme poor lack the power to determine their lives due to their economic condition. In the most severe cases it may be appropriate for the government to provide for them on an emergency basis (temporarily, and based on need). A second reply is that not all good things are automatically/necessarily the province of government - the extreme desirability of increased opportunity or care for the poor does not imply that it is government which should provide this care.

Income redistribution as a stated goal is difficult for me to accept. Relief in times of personal emergency has a naturally limited character to it, while income redistribution will tend to cease its own operation only upon reaching total equality of all persons in material condition. This equality depends on government control (preventing the immediate and drastic de-equalization as people make different choices with different results for their material well-being). This is obviously a situation of drastically reduced liberty, and one which I believe no one is arguing in favor of. (including Obama, the Left, the Clintons, etc)

So, instead, what is the solution (to the problem of rare but extreme poverty)?

Unfortunately it will take some time and require restraint on the part of government. These are not features which are popular in policy, but are often wise. Largely the task is to allow the poor and middle class to begin to accumulate wealth - if their standard of living is rapidly increasing, there is no case except envy which justifies excessive taxation or restraint of the rich. One obvious move would be to reform US agricultural policies, and stop holding wheat, milk, and other staple foods at fixed, high prices. This policy essentially robs from the poorest members of society to line the coffers of arbitrarily and randomly selected big business farmers (who otherwise would be forced to compete in offering higher-quality and more nutritious foodstuffs). Another would be to abandon rent controls where they have been adopted - these are well-meaning but have resulted in no end of grief for all involved, including shortage of housing. Another obvious policy move would be to reform taxation, ending many of the tax loopholes that interfere with decision-making and overall raise the tax burden of the poor and middle class.

Of course, there is a case to be made for direct emergency provision, but whether the government ought to provide this or a competent national charity, does not seem to be an already-decided issue. The historical pattern of many charities (most religious, unfortunately) providing for their own community has its own allure, but also its own drawbacks which I will not go into here.",progressive,-12,1388503497.0,comment

As such, if Goldman can influence the government to enforce rules in its favor, it doesn't need a militia because it controls the government's use of force. If the government cannot even create rules that could be construed as favorable to special interest, you are making the puppeteers puppet impotent. Therefore, the puppeteer will try something else.

I think the wisdom of this approach is suspect. I agree that there are gross examples of regulatory capture. I find the FCC to be particularly distasteful and think the only reform possible for it is to abolish it completely, but it's not clear that this is true for everything. I would think that the anti-trust division of the Justice Department shouldn't be abolished, but I've also seen it used unjustly and fail to regulate exactly what we want it to regulate. I think it's possible we just haven't come up with the right anti-trust mechanisms, but I certainly don't think we don't need anti-trust mechanisms. The shallow Libertarian seems to indicate that anti-trust protection is simply more unfettered competition, but I don't buy that.

I don't know what the answer is, but I don't think government is anemic at all. In the face of Goldman Sachs, it is *we the people* that are impotent. The government deals with the just fine. We must empower citizens to defend their interests as effectively as the large corporations.

Yeah. We know. That's kind of the thrust of the article. That you don't, can't or won't understand. 

But I'll restate it, because I was once a Libertarian and I'd still consider myself a champion of individual rights. But you see, I don't think it's an expression of liberty to reject ONE set of shackles upon my freedom in favor of a different and actually much heavier set.

It actually matters very LITTLE to me whom I'm being oppressed and exploited by, or even who benefits. Some vague collective good, some faceless plutocrat, whether you call it a tax or a fee for services; if I don't have a choice about it, that ain't nothin' like ""freedom.""

And you can't or won't see it, but for the vast majority of people, there are no MEANS - not enough economic liberty - to be actually free.

And you cannot, will not, do not admit that's a problem - hell, some of you deny poverty exists at all. This is why PZ Meyers is not engaging in a ""discussion"" about what you consider to be the ""issues."" He's given up in disgust and in point of fact, the core ideas of Libertarianism were developed from Classical Liberalism.

Which is what the sane and civilized among us have returned to. We shall retrace our steps in hopes of avoiding the diversions and pitfalls. Because I actually DO support individual liberty, it's now actually possible to implement that, but strangely enough, it's Libertarians and the like that are in the way of doing that.

He might realize that being beholden to the government for his livelihood is dangerous, as he has no control over programs which could be cut or reduced at any time, and for any reason. He might become despondent that other people have far more to say about how his life will turn out than he does.

He may seek to expand his sense of self-reliance by taking action to support himself and his family in other ways.

Governments are generally the only entity in a society that has legitimate claim to the use of violent force. Regulatory capture by corporations effectively transfers the power to use such violent force from the government to the corporation. The goal of a decentralized government is to spread control of violent force over as many independent bodies as possible, making the task of usurping that power for corporate gain more difficult and the task of maintaining control over that power more cumbersome and vulnerable to collective opposition from the members of society.

In this way, the decentralized governmental structure isn't intended to control a highly centralized corporation but instead to (A) mitigate the damage it can cause and (B) create a plethora of avenues for adjustment and response to bad behavior.

I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about the people who founded the ideology. People like Rothbard, Milton Freedman, Ayn Rand, Mises, whatever your flavor is. Their theories- and their followers- differ greatly but all have at least one thing in common. And that is that man should be free to acquire as much as he can. And that any land, capital, or property is rightful his, regardless of who is currently using it, who needs it, or the material circumstances that led up to whatever current state of ownership- is his to hoard. It is a system that leads to the centralization of wealth and power.

The problem with most regulations is often that they prevent the market from operating efficiently to the benefit of the entrenched party. If this were not the case, the entrenched party would be under competition and forced to change its behavior. I see this problem most poignantly in telecom and media. Others may have experiences that see it in other sectors.

Interestingly, the power to write rules entails the power to make exceptions. If the power was stripped to do this, there would be lest power to create loopholes. But as you say, how do we prevent something like fracking with poisonous materials. The answer the libertarians give is that the people who are affected by the behavior should be able to sue the responsible party, up to and including shuttering them. Currently, many regulations actually strip the ability of citizens to sue for damages, and if they can sue, the damages are capped to protect the companies. The libertarian position is that all of this needs to go a way and more general power must be granted to citizens to sue. Without this extra power, I agree with you, deregulation just means wanton destruction without consequence.

From a theoretical point of view this makes no sense. Classical liberalism is theoretically very well founded, universal, and justifiable; but liberal theory doesn't equate to libertarianism.

I recognize that it has lifted people out of poverty, but it still kept the economic hierarchy that created the systemic poverty in the first place and, because of the economic hierarchy, it can never fully eliminate poverty. Only the abolition of classes can do that.

Also, capitalism was developed under feudalism by the merchants as an attempt to gain power and wealth.

> Capitalism didn't exist for a long time

Capitalism as the ideological foundation of a *State* did not exist until relatively recently, but generalized capitalism working under other state systems of economics has been around for a *very* long time.  Private ownership of the means of production, even including more modern systems of shared private ownership through things like corporations, has been a driving force of markets for a millennium, if not arguably longer.  We exempt a lot of historical states because the *majority* of owners were long term aristocrats(but not all, aristocracy was not always only tied to hereditary titles).  We like to just call them ""markets"" and ""trade"".  Simple things, for ""primitive"" people.  Early trade based Mediterranean systems were largely Mercantile, in that the State organized outside trade.  But these were still massive empires that didn't fully control internal trade.  And frankly, not always even external trade or we likely wouldn't have seen the rise of Carthage out of the Phoenicians since they were a largely city-state based empire.  But, of course those who became wealthy through trade *became* aristocrats and are therefore exempt from being considered capitalist even though they were private individuals who owned the means of production, no?

> Capitalism was a reform that lifted many people out of poverty. This isn't really deniable, it's the whole motivation behind capitalism.

Woah, no.  Modern Capitalism arose out of 16th century Mercantilism.  Which arose out of the economic systems of the city states of Italy, Venice, Genoa, and Pisa.  It *arose*.  It was not a reform.  A gradual change from state organized trade to private organized trade in Mercantilism.  These private individuals were amassing enough wealth that as a whole they were able to compete with governments in long distance trade of goods.  Manufacture of goods had been a private enterprise for a very long time at this point.  Inequality abounded.  Sure, some people got wealthy, they rose up to compete with the exceptionally wealthy nobility.  (Though of course the nobility was not *always* incredibly wealthy.  Nobles during the crusades borrowed money from the merchants in the Mercantile states in Italy as well as elsewhere.  King Philip IV of France eradicated the Knights Templar partially since he was so in debt to them).  But the lower classes have been enormous and absolutely *necessary* for the function of every economic system our would has seen.

>This isn't really deniable, it's the whole motivation behind capitalism.

No, that would be profit.  Adam Smith wrote about it as a logical system to allow people to contribute their labor through specialization which would result in a surplus of goods.  Similar descriptions are seen throughout history.  One of my favorite examples is Ibn Khaldun's writings on a capitalist system in his chapter on Cities in his work *The Muqaddimah*(written in 1377 btw).  Just some of that labor is being exploited by the more wealthy.

> Trade-based economies are a liberal invention to counteract the regressive and problematic systems of dynastic rule, military rule, and despotism.

And this is a liberal whitewashing of history.  Which thoroughly disregards the private military of the East India Companies, use of government power by a private corporation, and extensive history of bribery and corruption.

I think there are far fewer of these than you seem to; certainly less than half. I know that they do exist, but I think the far more prevalent demographic are people that think they have no ability to better themselves because of what they have been told their entire lives. 

High school may in fact be too hard for some people. The concepts of high school are NOT too hard for anyone, except perhaps the profoundly mentally-handicapped. People's failures of education, and self-improvement, are in my opinion, largely *facilitated* by the environment that governmental education creates. It is one of helplessness, and fear of authority. 

These are not bad people; they are not lazy, they are not inept, they are not incapable. They have, however, been born into a society that tells them they are.

The one thing I've been surprised by most in my life, is how I was told that I was clever, and that going to college made me more intelligent than those that didn't make the cut, and finding out that it was a total lie. They are not as helpless as you think. Our society marginalizes those individuals with different kinds of intelligence and skills besides those focused on the academic, or the financial, but it's not the only kind of society that can exist. 

My dream of a more ideal society includes people being able to realize those skills and potentialities that the modern world would tell us are irrelevant. Everyone does have something to contribute to a society that works, and I don't mean just the sweat of their brow. This is not about leaving anyone behind, this is about true egalitarianism.

I know that I may be wrong too; It may be the case that humanity is much smaller than what I imagine that we're capable of. I can't personally abide seeing my fellow (wo)men as too small to be in control of their own destiny.

I'm not sure I agree with this. I have never seen a libertarian argue for a particular size, just ""smaller"".

I assume that, should rules about which regulations are acceptable and which aren't that government could and would continue to grow within those boundaries. So I don't think it's quantifiable size that counts but rather the properties on the domain of acceptable government behavior which would diminish.

> Otherwise it seems like you have to commit a tautology in order to justify your libertarian theory: ""my theory is good because it gets rid of government, and getting rid of government is good because [insert personal reasoning of why the government is bad]"".

I think you're trying to point out circular reasoning, not a vacuous tautology. Libertarian philosophy doesn't generally say that Libertarian philosophy is good because getting rid of government is good. That sounds like high school / early college thinkers trying to say ""my team is better than your team"". Libertarian philosophy starts from core values regarding individual liberty. It then describes government, quite accurately, as an institution of the collective which demands that individual liberties be abridged for the common good. Then, it moves on to state that the abridgment of individual liberty should be as limited as possible to promote the core value of individual liberty. Then, it attempts to argue for alternative solutions to collective problems that do not involve the abridgment of individual liberty. Finally, it argues that power tends to aggregate and corrupt and that not only are their alternatives to the current level of abridgment of individual liberty but that the powerfully corrupt abuse the collectives trust to harm us and, as such, it is important to strip the government of certain powers to ensure that the institution we trust remains trustworthy.

I don't really see tautology or circular reasoning in there. I see the law of unintended consequences for sure. I see over-reliance on market solutions over bureaucratic solutions without convincing evidence that the market is the right tool for each job. I see a blind-eye regarding the aggregation of power in other places besides the government as well as a lack of game-theory-based control to avoid unresolvable aggregations of power.

ceedgyr,">  Private ownership of the means of production, even including more modern systems of shared private ownership through things like corporations, has been a driving force of markets for a millennium

But 1000 years is a short time compared to the history of civilization and the problems of poverty. As you go on to state, aristocrats with hereditary titles were generally the means of owning things. Further, the actual transference of wealth had nothing to do with abstractions of capital but instead were almost always directly tied to dynastic considerations, hence marriage being such a massively important political institution.

>  Modern Capitalism arose out of 16th century Mercantilism. Which arose out of the economic systems of the city states of Italy, Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. It arose. It was not a reform.

Granted, bad choice of words in some respects. My point was primarily that merchants were almost always untitled citizens in the early days of mercantilism. They served dynastic families in facilitating economic exchange because it was more expedient than those families hoarding until they could speak directly with some other family in a far off land. Mercantilism introduced liquidity and began generating the more modern formulations of markets. It was the eventual shift from dynastic regimes to economic regimes that led to the removal of dynasties as the single most important political factor in the lives of all commoners. From a merchants perspective, I would consider this a reform on their part. They saw they had power but not enough and they worked to reform the existing power structure in their favor. In so doing....

> Adam Smith wrote about it as a logical system to allow people to contribute their labor. Just some of that labor is being exploited by the more wealthy.

Which ultimately resulted in far MORE liquidity than ever before seen in the history of civilization and the continued growth of the fabled ""middle class"" which is defined by people that don't control their lives but still have enough purchasing power to satisfy needs AND wants. This is source of my statement that bringing people out of poverty being the entire point. The entire point is that the more people participating in the market place, trading more freely in self-interest, creates greater aggregate economic well-being than previously known. And I think this is historically true, even if there exist better alternatives, I don't think it's deniable that the shift from dynastic central planning, to mercantilistic central planning, to unplanned markets and the promotion of a consumer class has been a progression towards lower global aggregate poverty.

> a liberal whitewashing of history.  Which thoroughly disregards

> the private military of the East India Companies

I wouldn't say it disregards it. The private military of the East India Companies was a great liberty taken by a group merchants that believed they could explore and colonize far more efficiently than their government could. And they were right about that. They were also brutal and murderous, but they succeeded where many government efforts failed.

> use of government power by a private corporation

Again, not disregarding it. Regulatory capture happens and is a travesty. It's BETTER than despotism, but not by much, and anyone interested in liberal philosophy needs to consider regulatory capture a problem for personal liberty.

> and extensive history of bribery and corruption

Huh? This hasn't gotten better or worse. I mean, maybe better, as we seem to see less bribery overall in the Western 1st world when compared to the developing and 3rd worlds. Not sure how it comes into play here. It's rampant, it's everywhere, no one has a good solution to it except vigilance.

> the value slavery had in the rising capitalist economy in the United States

Not disregarding it. Slavery was a violent acquisition of capital and sadly a widespread systemic one. The only way to fix it ex post facto is to recognize that existing ownership is not legitimate and then move from there. There's 2 options: incrementally chip away at these pools of ownership (estate tax) or dash it all (revolution). Neither of these came into consideration in stating that market capitalism has been the agenda of those attempting to increase liberty in comparison to those holding to strict dynastic rule.

> essential continuation of slavery in the form of Corporate Towns

I am not familiar with the term and will do research.

> Capitalism is just another form of Tyranny

I would say more that tyranny has always existed and people continue to seek power. Capitalism has mechanisms by which power can be aggregated and wielded. But I don't think that Capitalism was invented by tyrants to continue their strangehold. Ultimately, capitalism and market-driven economies are what made dynasties obsolete as liquidity increased and societies became more willing to trust more people in economic dealings. We will continue to expand that trust, to continue to make power aggregation obsolete, and maybe even eliminate the idea of private ownership.

I believe this to be one of the greatest failings of their political philosophy.

> Who is the entrenched party regarding health and safety laws or environmental regulation? How do these prevent competition?

If you've never tried to start your own business you probably wouldn't have run into this. If you have, you may have not run into this. But many businesses have to spend a lot of money to get over regulatory hurdles to even begin operation, even if their business is not really presenting a risk. This is the way bureaucracy kills things. Regulations are wide reaching and open to interpretation and the interpretation generally is done by the government agency and creates costs for private business.

A friends NYC restaurant was inspected and docked heavily because of an unwashed cheese grater. The problem is that the cheese grater was hanging from the ceiling of the kitchen and never used by the cooks, it wasn't a tool used to prep food, but it was present in the kitchen, suspended by a wire. The cost for re-inspection was several thousand dollars. Another friend's restaurant was told he MUST have a hand-washing sink at the counter where sushi was being prepared, but the place was so tiny all the chef had to do was turn around and take 2 steps (or 1 large one) and he'd be at the sink. In order to satisfy the regulation, the owner had to take a saw to the counter, cut a hole in it, insert a sink basin, and since there was no plumbing at that precise spot he had to run hoses from the old sink to the new one just to satisfy the regulation. These are relatively common and simple in NYC restaurants. Bigger problems arise when $10k pieces of equipment are the only things that satisfy a particular regulation when business is barely clearly that much in revenue, or when the documentation requirement is so large you need to retain a consulting firm for 50-man hour a quarter, just to process 150-page regulatory compliance documents.

All of these things cost money. Competition only works efficiently when little guys can get started and turn into middle-sized guys and, in the aggregate, serve enough customers to provide price and quality competition to the big guys. Small things like going from an A to B in health department grading over a cheese grater and a single tomato wrapped in saran wrap but not in the fridge (btw, refrigerated tomatoes are terrible) can be enough to drive a NYC restaurant out of business in under 6 months. The requirement to buy $10k pieces of equipment are often far too much to bear and require either a bank loan or cause the entrepreneur to not even attempt it and move on to another project.

But the most important question you raised:

> Can ordinary people really match the resources of big business?

This is a major problem with our judicial system, no matter what political ideology or philosophy we are talking about. For the Libertarians to even have a chance at making their position tenable, we have to reform the judicial system to make it easier citizens to have their grievances redressed and harder for well-moneyed defendants to escape unscathed.

That doesn't represent your position.  It's saying the media's depiction of libertarianism is the same as your portrayal.  If you both espouse the same idea, it'd be hard for you to say you don't accept the media's portrayal, right?  It makes no assumptions about your _position_ at all.

Well, maybe the not wanting to understand it bit.  In my defense, that's easy to conclude when you tell me Rothbard, Freedman, Mises and Rand(!) founded libertarianism.  Libertarianism started in the 18th century in France.  Libertarianism was the foundation on which Marx and Engels built Socialism and Communism.  If you'd _wanted_ to learn about libertarianism, wikipedia will teach you this in less than 15 minutes.

Hell, Rand hated libertarianism and said so - perhaps because she understood it as a basis for the Communism which took all her toys away and made her into a bitter, second-rate hack ""philosopher.""  So I apologize if I misrepresented your position, but I don't see where I was attacking a straw man.  I'm attacking the very real (and politically convenient) misrepresentation of libertarianism that that the media portrays.

>I'm talking about the people who founded the ideology. People like Rothbard, Milton Freedman, Ayn Rand, Mises, whatever your flavor is. Their theories- and their followers- differ greatly but all have at least one thing in common. And that is that man should be free to acquire as much as he can. And that any land, capital, or property is rightful his, regardless of who is currently using it, who needs it, or the material circumstances that led up to whatever current state of ownership- is his to hoard. It is a system that leads to the centralization of wealth and power.

Not to flog it, but like I said the people you cite as founders/ideological leaders weren't founders.  Then your talk about the leaders of a group who are characterized by their lack of faith in leadership is ironic at best.  This is what I mean about the media's portrayal of libertarianism, but that's not the straw man bit.

""Their theories- and their followers- differ greatly but all have at least one thing in common.""  Now you've got us all under your paintbrush.  We all believe these things you go on to enumerate.

This whole thread started with ""Libertarian =/= capitalist"" but you're going to soldier on as if it were.  That's a complete misrepresentation of my position and it was willful, as I made it perfectly clear from the start that capitalism has no inherent relationship to libertarianism.  What you're attacking here* is Anarcho-Capitalism, which _is_ a libertarian ideology, but only _one_ circle in the Venn diagram depicting libertarianism.  AnCap=capitalist, yes.  Libertarian=capitalist, definitely not.

The things you write here are to a greater or lesser extent the beliefs of the people you cite*, and those people have inspired a legion of embarrassed Republicans to start declaring themselves libertarians, but that doesn't make it so, nor does it define libertarianism.  That is, literally, the entire point I was trying to make when I posted in this thread.

   

 * ""And that any land, capital, or property is rightful his, regardless of who is currently using it, who needs it, or the material circumstances that led up to whatever current state of ownership- is his to hoard.""  I'm no fan of this crowd, but this cannot be said to accurately represent the beliefs of Friedman / Mises / Rothbard as written.  They believed in property rights etc. as being very important (they're capitalists, after all), but they thought the NAP (Non-Aggression Principal) was the postulate on which everything else (in Anarcho-Capitalism) was founded.

No, it's not. Aggression is defined as physical against person or property. If you have hired a militia and bring it to bear against others you are in violation of the social contract and are therefore now eligible for punishment by the collective. In most Libertarian formulations, this punishment is enacted by collectively managed private armed forces that are only used against violent aggressors that have broken the social contract. If instead I do something like insult you, the police force would not be eligible as a response. If you struck me, the police force would become an eligible response.",progressive,-2,1388511341.0,comment

cefq4h3,"A core tenet of Libertarian thought is the ""Non-Aggression Principle,"" which would assert that intentionally poisoning someone (or an entire population through toxic chemicals in a river) is an act of aggression and therefore immoral. This principle also applies to personal property. It is not a matter of ""fuck you, got mine."" It is a respect for your right to personal property and an expectation that you will be obliged to show me the same respect; that I will not attempt to take what is your propert by force, nor should I be subject to use of force to divest me of my property. (This gets a little tricky when justifying some stable funding for even a minimalist government, but within a certain framework I am willing to be flexible and accept a ""lesser-of-two-evils."" TBH, this is a problem I am actively working to resolve philosophically and practically.)

As for utilities, the government provides protections to the current providers and has institutionalized barriers to market entry, improperly protecting certain corporations from competition. This is one wholly improper misuse of state authority that Libertarians hope to correct. Competition among providers always benefits the consumer by allowing alternatives. For a long time,  television companies fought cable and manipulated the FCC to prevent competition. Then consumers got a choice. Then cable companies fought satelite (and still do) but that too has become more common. The result is now these companies are forced to appeal to consumers by offering improved service and lower prices, all thanks to competition among providers. With government enforced monopoly, they could charge anything they want and provide shitty service because there would be no alternative. This principle applies to every business; it only gets better when consumers have more freedom of choice and worse when there is no freedom to switch to another provider.

The idea that Libertarians are ""beholden to nothing but what people are willing to pay"" is nothing more than demonization intended to cast them as ""greedy monsters,"" or simply ammoral. Libertarians are people too, with compassion and a desire to help others succeed as much as they hope to succeed themselves, just like everyone else. The core principles dictate that any right I expect to enjoy I must also apply equally to my fellow citizens. Libertarian ideals do not preach or endorse racism in any way. Nor sexism. Nor classism. Nor withholding the right to marry just because you are gay. It is ultimately a Humanist philosophy (imho). The accusation of ""greed"" is based on the mischaracterization of the Libertarian belief that all human interactions are ""transactions"" of one kind or another.  If I have labor and you have money, we trade. This is called ""working for a living."" It's not a radical concept and it has nothing to do with wanting to harm anyone or fuck people over. It is a principle that dictates value for value and applies equally to chraitable acts. If I give freely of my time, effort or money to help a person in need, I get the value of exercising my compassion and making the world a better place. All of this is fully consistent with Libertarian ideals.

As for ""school indoctrination,"" this is a more difficult argument to make. But, again imho, the evidence is there. The schools are run by the government and are heavily biased towards teaching that government is the only valid solition to a variety of social, moral and personal ills. This is the epitome of state-run propaganda being taught to children, and thus constitites ""indoctrination."" Lest you be confused, this has nothing to do with objecting to education itself, nor with wishing to withhold education from anyone. It is an appeal to incorporate alternative ideas with equal or superior validity into the curriculum. It is also an appeal to allow and in fact promote more alternatives to state-run schools with the purpose of improving education through competition, allowing people more freedom of choice so that they can switch educational providers if they wish. The government monopoly on education has degraded the quality of education overall and prevents necessary and proper improvement.",progressive,1,1388695735.0,comment

cee9flp,"While I understand the metaphorical similarities, I believe it is the actual difference between individual and state that the Libertarian uses to argue for the damage of any government larger than minuscule.

By way of easy example, let's look at regulatory capture. A regulatory body, influenced by a large and old business entity (Big W), unilaterally uses the powers of regulation granted to it by the Congress to determine that selling used Widgets requires a license. The justification is cited as being that old Widgets can potentially be dangerous to consumers. However, the true economic impact is that many of Big Ws competitors go out of business due to the cost of compliance, future potential competitors have a larger barrier to entry, and consumers have reduced choices in where to go to buy Widgets. Now, let's say I open a used Widget shop and begin selling without a license. What will happen? My neighbors won't confront me. Big W has no recourse. Instead, armed officers will approach me at my place of business or my home. They will most likely not be violent, though given the use of [force](http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/tarrant/Owners-irked-after-raid-on-Arlingtons-Garden-of-Eden--219354841.html) against this [organic farm](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/texas-swat-team-conducts-_n_3764951.html) in Texas, I'm no longer sure it will be a calm visit. Regardless, failure to comply with the demands to stop selling Widgets will result in armed officers physical detaining me and imprisoning me.

To recap, people elected officials, elected officials appointed trusted officials, trusted officials acted without direct elected official influence (therefore the action was not directly approved by the ""will of the people"") but with the direct influence of a business entity seeking to use violence to improve its business prospects, the threat of violent force is used to enforce a regulation that harms many and benefits few.

This is not a situation where there would be equivalence. I think anyone would be hard pressed to find an equivalent individual use of force that mirrors this scenario. Thus, I contend that the governmental use of force is not identical to the limited use of force afforded citizens. Citizens may use force only for self preservation against a clear and present danger. Government may use force in the interest of long-term self-preservation, the maintenance of behavioral codes, and any other interest it may seek to promote.

So while I agree that there exist checks and balances, due process, and the rule of law, I believe that the entire point of contention between political philosophies is whether or not the current implementation and surrounding foundation are the most just. Libertarians argue that the problem is precisely that government has an influence over so wide a playing field that the defenses we have for self-regulating are insufficient to ensure a just society. They argue that we must fundamentally limit the scope of government to have any hope that our tools for self-governance are effective. In contrast, people who push for greater government power believe the problem is that governments are powerless to stop the constantly growing influence of purely economic entities and that government must continue to grow and evolve much as the corporate entity does.

My impression was that you were speaking of libertarianism, as in, the 21st century, western variant. I'm aware of the *other*, maybe 'real' forms of libertarianism that you're describing. I have gotten used to referring to 'libertarianism' as 'anarcho-capitalism' for the sake of the times.

I disagree. They may differentiate between a violent physical takeover and a subtle economic takeover. They may disagree with using physical force to take property. But they still support systematically depriving people of land and resources if it suits the individual's goals. They don't call for this specifically, but maintain that it'd be legitimate if it happened. I would call that violent. If only subtle.

You won't, that's the point. 
You always have to accept a lesser of two evils and more often than not the Libertarian Party offers up peacemeal solutions that improve ""liberty"" in one regard while committing an aggressive act towards others, i.e. laws that cripple social safety nets without creating any transition to stabilize the lives and health of thousands before the free market does it's undeniable and completely sacred magic and fixes everything. There is a philosophical validity to Libertarianism, and the idea of preesrving freedom. There is little to no validity in the established Libertarian Party, and I don't really have to prove that because even if I'm wrong they'll never win an election to prove me so. 

Would you support regulation to prevent oligarchy, like heavy restrictions on Lobbyists and Public Campaign funding? The re-establishment of the estate tax Pre Bush Era? The closing of a majority of tax loopholes that ensure that our GDP decays from within? Because every 'Libertarian"" solution I've heard has a glaring issue that will likely make things worse, e.g. kill school funding because if there is a demand for schools they will be built and everyone will have the chance to go to them which will prevent us from sinking back into an era where only wealthy white males were educated enough to become policy-makers...wait...

I just want to know why you think the Libertarian Party as it exists will ever be able to do any better given its constituents than any other political ideology that inherently creates a platform for the regulation of trade of goods and services? Just like Socialism, there don't have to be issues with the ideology for there to be massive pitfalls in its implementation. If you're not a Libertarian Utopian, why bother aligning yourself with the actual Party as it is a failure? If you are, then surely you must realize that all Utopias share the common flaw of human will? 


So my real question: why are you a Libertarian if it's not going to make a difference anyway?

I *assume* my drinking water is safe. I *assume* if I called the police, they would come to my house. Am I wrong for holding those assumptions? Of course not.

While you're busy attacking the argument itself instead of the content, you've already lost the audience, made your own argument weaker and and did not advance the discussion. You could have avoided it by pointing out the assumption then commenting on *why* that assumption is wrong. That latter bit is the important part.

ceefdjz,"We define rules because as of yet our species lacks the individual autonomy to survive alone or in significant isolation relative to the status quo.

""Rules"" are arguably not totally necessary, but as a means of convenience and talent humans are able to establish language and shared terms for things (using a language is technically following a rule, and personally in the midst of existential fuck-all I'm glad to be a slave to my words sometimes) and this evolves into systems. The systems are not perfect and perhaps our greatest flaw is our willingness to buy into our own BS and believe that the rules are perfect simply because they are intended to be common. Upon basic logical examination we know that just because something is law does not make it right, but we also operate on a day to day basis with a very strong sense of our own moral guidelines and regardless of our level of self-awareness or the context in which we formed them. Most often (the majority of differing cases being considered abberations, perhaps unfairly) these moral codes, no matter how nuanced they become, hold some common elements from the society and thus we find that though rules are fallible and must be allowed to change they are also a powerful way to communicate the experience of time to young generations without requiring them to know every hour of the past. 

Breaking the mold is important for testing our ontological limits, but I'm uncomfortable with anyone who says that suffering and immensely wasteful loss of life is acceptable in the pursuit of anything man wants to create or build or invent or whatehavyou, conceptual or otherwise.

ceeazpd,">By way of easy example, let's look at regulatory capture. A regulatory body, influenced by a large and old business entity (Big W), unilaterally uses the powers of regulation granted to it by the Congress to determine that selling used Widgets requires a license. The justification is cited as being that old Widgets can potentially be dangerous to consumers. However, the true economic impact is that many of Big Ws competitors go out of business due to the cost of compliance, future potential competitors have a larger barrier to entry, and consumers have reduced choices in where to go to buy Widgets. Now, let's say I open a used Widget shop and begin selling without a license. What will happen? My neighbors won't confront me. Big W has no recourse. Instead, armed officers will approach me at my place of business or my home. They will most likely not be violent, though given the use of force against this organic farm in Texas, I'm no longer sure it will be a calm visit. Regardless, failure to comply with the demands to stop selling Widgets will result in armed officers physical detaining me and imprisoning me.

I don't believe one has to be a Libertarian to look at fixing a situation like this. I'm a very left-leaning individual, and I see the value in observing these types of regulations and figuring out which ones are necessary and which ones need to go. 

I don't agree with permits just for the sake of collecting taxes. Permits should be required only to keep a business from harming its employees or customers, either through rotten food or shoddy construction, etc. 

Let's not forget that there are ""permits"" from the corporate world as well. Patent trolls and ASCAP spring to mind immediately. If you want to have a band play at your bar, and they happen to play a cover, expect to pay an ASCAP fee or get sued. These kinds of corporate-induced ""regulations"" would increase if we shifted power from governments to corporations.

I've asked in reddit random related reddit threads and on the sanders subreddit - people there either ignore, downvote or agree with me - no counter arguments that giving 11 million amnesty will attract more who will then need to be given amnesty.

Sanders own page uses historical data which would then be irrelevant as evidence in favor of his policys, and Sanders own words write off anyone who would question the idea as right-wing and racist.

Sanders is a proponent of completely open borders and no qualifications on becoming a citizen. You want in? You're in. No such thing as an illegal immigrant, everyone is welcome.  As president he is in a position to direct the military to enforce (or not) those laws and also give pardon/amnesty to mass amounts of people.

That is incorrect. [Here is his immigration policy.](https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-fair-and-humane-immigration-policy/)

As you can see, he clearly supports a strong, secure, modernized border. He simply wants to reduce the militarization of the border, and to reduce border deaths.

As to amnesty, he wants to defer deportation for those that have been here for 5 years, to implement a ""best interests of the child"" standard for some cases, and to provide a *path to* citizenship for those that are already here and contributing to our society. There are many other provisions, like allowing undocumented immigrants living here to buy healthcare through the ACA (to lower healthcare costs), but I think it's pretty obvious that it's nowhere near ""everyone gets in and stays in"".

But it all comes down to how obviously that is rigged against Bernie.  If he wins say 60-70% of the elected delegates, and loses the nomination at the DNC, that could be just the spark the political revolution needs.  Honestly, Bernie's honest when he says it's not just about the presidency.  People from fairly broad on the political spectrum are wanting to knock out most incumbents and put people that are not part of the established parties or beholden to corporations.  On the right, it shows itself fairly differently, but some of the right is moving more center away from both the Tea Party fringe and the big government GOP (the same ones that complain about big government are in fact, big government)

So the House and Senate races should get interesting, with both parties being pressed by their supporters to have more independent candidates.  

But if there's some shady bullshit at the convention, in either party, that could push a critical mass of their supporters away.

If the idea behind amnesty is that you will be paid fairly, and that because there are no illegal immigrants there will be no under paid under class.

However Bernie states he will stop deportations, decrease border enforcement and not increase anything which would work against illegal immigration.

If the plan is to remove the class of illegal immigrant in order to increase wages, combined with looser border enforcement, it follows that he will continually have to grant amnesty, otherwise the underclass will still exist and the other actions pointless.

czgdbwb,"I vehemently agree that the quota system (legal immigration) needs a retooling. Immigration reform is critically important - there's way too much whackiness and nonsense, standards are too high and the process takes too long. Illegal immigration would be less of an issue (though definitely not simply resolved) by fixing the system of legal immigration.

I see now you didn't accuse me of racism, I was perhaps basing my response upon the slew of other comments I was getting, saw some similar keywords and unfairly lumped a point in here. My apologies. 

However I'm still not convinced that Bernie's proposals aren't intended to be akin to open-borders.  The crux of that belief is that amnesty for 11 million will not discourage others from immigrating illegally. That in order to make the first amnesty worthwhile (if the intention is to remove second class, illegal wage citizens), amnesty will have to be continually granted. 

I actually went though and read all of Bernie's proposals again just now, and they seem more rational than I originally thought. I still think that in order to achieve the intent of Amnesty to the first 11 million, it will have to be continually granted, but I can see that he's not looking at defunding the border and directing resources elsewhere as I had read previously. (I'm pretty sure I had read that on Bernie's own site- which is what caused my initial trepidation) -- in fact, I think Bernie's page on immigration has been updated in the last two weeks because some of the direct quotes I used in previous commentary on the subject are no longer there. 

I agree that immigration is important and vital to our growth, I'm not against immigration nor do I think that only the wealthy and entitled should be allowed it - however I'm still not 100% sold on Bernie's immigration policy, due to what I see will be a need for continued amnesty. Though when compared to Trumps, Bernie's seems more conservative and thoughtful.

However your arguments are based on sound bytes and stone walling. Assumptions and biased confirmation.

 How can you be racist against a class of illegal actions? It'd be racist to be against a race, like hispanic / latin - but illegal immigrants make up a wide range of people and are not a US-Centric issue or from a specific country or ethnicity. If you cannot address (redress?) illegal immigrants, if you can't approach the topic without labeling anyone who disagrees with your position as racist, you're not discussing, you're stroking your ego.

I have shown, through my comments, that I am reachable and considerate.  

Again I prompt: that if 11 million illegal immigrants are given amnesty and citizenship, 
that more will come for the same - and even though that it's not stated outright that the plan is open borders - because if the intent is to bring people up, to remove an economic class of exploited people - you can't just do it once and then not again - because in this situation specifically, you'll still have people who are an economically exploited class. They'll come for the amnesty, eventual citizenship and work, even if that's at lower than standard wages, even if that is exploited.  

Furthermore, if we still have a legal immigration process that's not been reformed/addressed, what's the point of waiting on that if you can simply come over and get amnesty? 

My ""blatent lies"" are critical thinking, analysis and opinion. If A, then AB. (edit: Formulated further by 'from the horses' mouth comments)

As with the War on Drugs, when America has an incredibly counterproductive, hurtful, and downright murderous policy (lots of people die thwarting border control, and less than 1% of them aren't doing it as job seekers or family members of job seekers) the smart thing to do goes beyond ending the wasteful spending on making life miserable for innocent human beings and into the realm of reversing sentences and terminating prosecutions for violators of the stupid murderous law.  Also, the small number of illegal border crossings that lack a wholesome motivation could then be policed much more effectively, since our border control resources wouldn't also be chasing down countless migrant laborers.

Do you think Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, etc. really have America's best interests at heart, or can you see them for the dishonest/ignorant self-promoting scumbags they are?  If so, then you should have no more trouble tolerating amnesty for ""illegals"" (another term pounded into the millions of unwitting sock puppets through endless repetition) than you would have trouble tolerating a blanket pardon of all non-violent drug offenders who were not convicted of involuntarily intoxicating a minor or other third party.",progressive,2,1454089245.0,comment
czgsqam,">Assumptions 

This is hilarious. I'm going off your own words; meanwhile, you're entire argument is based off the assumption that Sanders wants open borders (which he doesn't) and that his supporters disagree with him on immigration (which they don't). This is exactly the kind of projection we constantly see from right wingers.

>I have shown, through my comments, that I am reachable and considerate. 

No, you've shown through you're comments that you're a racist, dishonest asshole.

>Furthermore, if we still have a legal immigration process that's not been reformed/addressed, what's the point of waiting on that if you can simply come over and get amnesty? 

Reforming the immigration process is part of his plan. His plan doesn't consist entirely of ""Give amnesty to 11 million undocumented immigrants for no other reason than to piss of the racists"".

>My ""blatent lies"" are critical thinking, analysis and opinion.

TIL spouting blatantly false bullshit is considered ""critical thinking"" by racists.

>I'm open minded and receptive - I genuinely care and want to be right, but I'm not above reproach, nor changing my opinion when introduced to logical, verifiable facts.

Right wing scumbag is stupid enough to use the ""I'm not a right winger"" gambit.

Here's a question, why is that you racist fuckwits are always so proud of your racism, defending it not matter oh much your shown to be wrong, but then you get upset when the label is actually applied to you? If your so proud to be a willfully ignorant bigot then own up to the fact that you're a willfully ignorant bigot.",progressive,1,1454099058.0,comment

The difference between Clinton and Sanders in respect to fundraising for down ticket candidates is that I find that the Sanders campaign is learning as they go, while Clinton has had the entire system already figured out for years, maybe decades. I don't think it's that he or his campaign doesn't want to fundraise or support other progressives, it's more a matter of time and resources that they've only now begun to accumulate as the campaign has moved forward. The network is being built as the campaign goes on. It's evident in the switch in tone of the campaign itself in the last few weeks since the big losses—now it's building a lasting progressive movement and demanding a progressive platform at the convention, not just winning the nomination. They're winging it the best they can, which is why Grassroots Select and other emerging independent movements are so important; like Sanders' campaign itself it's not a top-down movement which Bernie's stressed repeatedly.

Standard practice? Only one justice has died or retired during an election year in the last 80 years. Sherman Minton retired in 1956, and was replaced by William Brennan via Eisenhower's recess appointment.

Before that, in 1932, Oliver Wendell Holmes retired and Cardozo was appointed and confirmed.

He can only do that while the Senate is in recess, though. The Senate is currently in recess, but Obama already said he won't do that now.

He could do in next time they recess (in theory) but congressional leaders have resorted to holding symbolic sessions in the past to prevent recesses from technically being long enough with the sole purpose of preventing recess appointments.

High turnout always favors the Democratic party. So your analogy doesn't even make sense. This is why the GOP is the party of voter suppression. They want the disenfranchised to stay home.

Strange thing to say about someone who has ""serious ethical questions"".

Obama then voted to filibuster Alito, and when that failed, he voted against his nomination on **what he admits** was purely ideological grounds.

I'm skeptical you could find a nominee that both the current GOP and Democratic parties would be OK with, so I'm unconvinced you could get a Republican president to nominate somebody we'd find acceptable.",progressive,-1,1455650090.0,comment

Except he never obstructed one. 

I did read your link, but it was a non-sequiter since it makes no mention of the Majority Leader threatening to violate the constitution.  Since you seem lost I will attempt to educate you again.

On a questionnaire for the Senate Judiciary Committee in his Third Circuit Court-of-Appeals confirmation process in 1990, Alito said he would avoid a conflict of interest by not voting on cases involving First Federal Savings & Loan of Rochester, NY, and two investment firms, Smith Barney and Vanguard Group, because he held accounts with them. However, in 2002, Alito upheld a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit filed against multiple investment company defendants, including Vanguard Group. When notified of the situation, Alito denied doing anything improper but recused himself from further involvement in the case. The case was reheard with the new panel coming to the same conclusion.

On November 10, Judge Alito wrote to Senator Specter, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, explaining his participation in the case.[1] He said that when he had originally listed Vanguard and Smith Barney in 1990, ""my intention was to state that I would never knowingly hear a case where a conflict of interest existed. [...] As my service continued, I realized that I had been unduly restrictive.""

During witness testimony of Alito's confirmation hearings, witness John Payton (member of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary) testified: ""In the end, he did acknowledge that it was his responsibility that a mistake and error had been made. Those cases should have been caught and he should have not heard those cases.""

Alito was rated by the American Bar Association as “Well Qualified”, which is the ABA's highest recommendation. In a letter[2] to the Judiciary Committee, Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, Stephen Tober, reviewed Alito's failure to recuse himself in Vanguard and Smith Barney matters, and a third case where a conflict was alleged. Tober concluded:

While I agree you are a hypocrite, nothing you have said has any bearing on the Senate Majority Leader's threat to violate the constitution.  Thank you for admitting you lied about the filibuster and that Obama blocked a vote.

By ""his pet project"" you must mean the law of the land. You know, the one that Mitt Romney first instated in Massachusetts? 

>His illegal Executive order to try to protect the cockroach illegals in this country from deportation

Illegal? Have you looked at the numbers of immigrants Reagan and Bush gave amnesty to? Also, it's offensive to refer to your fellow human beings as ""cockroaches"". I sincerely hope that you never find yourself at the mercy of others. Do you know anything about the history of executive orders or are you just committed to making an ass of yourself online?

What does this have to do with political appointments or Congress even? You look here asshole. People died. Sure you're entitled to your opinion and the right to express it, but so am I. You are sub human. You're scum. 

>The ACA

Didn't you already mention this? It's the law. Why is that so difficult to understand? Even a conservative SCOTUS failed at bringing it down, though they did largely declaw it. I'm sure that you'd rather poor people just die. It's okay. We understand. You're a terrible human being. 

>His refusal to condemm Islamic Terrorism

I'm pretty sure that he's personally commanded thousands of bombing strikes against terrorists. As a veteran who worked in aviation, I know this is no small feat. He has condemned terrorism. If you want him to say the words ""Islamic terrorism"" I suggest you sit on your hands. In the meanwhile, I'm going to continue to talk about how Christian extremism affects my life, directly as an American. 

>His insulting Congress over the ""refugees"" when even the FBI director states we can't vet all that Obama wants to bring in.

This is unsubstantiated bullshit. Btw, how do you suggest we go about ""vetting"" homegrown right-wing terrorists? Should we check you out first? 

>His arming of Mexican Cartels to murder Border Patrol Agents

Fast and Furious? Well, that is an actual fuck up, but I wouldn't put it on the president. Maybe Holder or everything that involves the war on drugs. Those assholes have had free reign to do as they like under any administration. And that obviously comes from the Republican side although Clinton also supported it. Oh I forgot, it's impossible for you to learn from history.

Of the ways to argue in favor of Sanders and (presumably) against Clinton, this one seems most bizarre, because it's not hurting anyone and it's not immoral.

csytzpj,"Okay, you're conflating two things here.

First, I agree with you that having a government made up of wealthy people seems like a bad thing.  And perhaps it is, although I'd be fairly quick to point out that *most* of our presidents have been far wealthier than the average US citizen.

That aside, I think *how* a person makes their money is as important as whether or not they have it.  Barack Obama is a millionaire, but he made his money literally through the sales of his books.

Jeb Bush comes from family money.

The Clintons-- both of them-- came from middle class families.

So this comment:

>There is nothing morally wrong with having a silver spoon in your mouth but don't expect those without spoons to trust your judgement on the best way to acquire your first spoon.

Is actually a little misplaced if you're discussing Hillary Clinton.  Yes, she has millions of dollars now, but she hasn't always.  The ""silver spoon in the mouth"" analogy is not really all that apt in her case.

If you and others think Bernie Sanders is the answer to all our problems, that's fine.  If you want to promote him as a decent guy and a champion of the middle class, that's fine, too.  I happen to agree with some of that sentiment.

What I disagree with is the way things like this are being brought up.  Bernie Sanders's lack of financial assets that Clinton has is not a significant point in his favor, it's being brought up to try to make him look moral and selfless, and Hillary Clinton look greedy and selfish.",progressive,3,1436551981.0,comment

That is not a pejorative conclusion about the Clinton Foundation. Per your link: ""Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity.""

That's an internal review by the Clinton Foundation itself.

Your BBB link only says that the material provided to the BBB by the Clinton Foundation is being reviewed by the BBB. Again, there is no basis to presume this is a pejorative action.

Detroit snubbed their nose at the Prius: it's a fad, too difficult to engineer/build and proceeded to crush all the EV1's.  The lack of vision is legendary. 

The American's stumbled and the Japanese took over.

Detroit has difficulty competing with well designed efficiency. They continually respond with vehicle that are mostly legislated out of existence in other countries due to size or efficiency (Explorer's, Durangos and Expeditions...and the right-sized Excursion).   American's just seem to want oversized, inefficient and poorly engineered vehicles...the sales numbers speak for themselves. 

What I don't understand is why when Ford comes up with super cool car that can be sold with a $100K dealer mark up, they only make 4000 of them. And follow it up with a model that they only make a few hundred,  require an application to purchase one and  have standing offers from people denied purchase offering $200K above sticker.  It is insulting. ",progressive,4,1471308442.0,comment

d6jjoz0,"Exactly how is what goes on inside an office occurring ""outside market oriented systems""? There is constant pressure for productivity increases coming from upper management with the source being the pressure to compete in the market.

You speak like someone who's never actually worked an office job.  In reality things like productivity are notoriously hard to quantify, and trying to nail down the causes of improvements in work quality is an exercise in frustration. Upper management has their ideas, but nobody really knows what their doing. I don't mean this in a nasty way, they are frequently (but not always) smart, well educated people who work very hard, but the systems are so complex that the idea that market systems could work as efficiently as you seem to think is incredibly naive.

Market incentIves exist in this system but big companies are too large for the efficient market hypothesis to apply. All this is a long winded way of saying that if you think market forces are going to let me shop around for a company that pays me a bonus based on productivity,  you've got another thing coming. Office jobs just don't work like that. Productivity is not significantly related to the salaries of mid level IT jobs. It's based on supply and demand, not fundamentals like productivity.

d6jkb8l,"I agree with a lot that you have written, but the point is that there are incentives in place to correct inefficiencies. Someone looses money over this. Every day production structures are evolving to eliminate waste. 

The reason you think that nobody knows what they're doing is because you look at everything that does not work, all the unsolved problems and imperfections of the real world. Try comparing the work of say the DMV to that of a private company like whatever, SAP and you will see the difference of market oriented and non market oriented.

If you think about it on an abstract level, what we are doing is integrating people into a worldwide system of resource allocation and production. The question is how do you get people to work for one another. The answer to that is of course not simple and in fact changes every day. 

Production and supply/demand are interwoven. I don't know what you mean. 

In a market environment ideas that work will push out bad ideas comparable to what happens in the natural world. It's not even necessary for anyone involved to understand what's going on. My question is with what would anyone here replace this evolutionary process?..and why for that matter. Critizicing this process seems like the height of arrogance.",progressive,1,1471347898.0,comment
d6jkyzv,"> Production and supply/demand are interwoven. I don't know what you mean.

So is labor cost and supply/demand, but that doesn't mean the labor theory of value is correct. You seem to be promoting a kind of productivity theory of salaries. Productivity and labour cost create constraints on pay but the overriding determiner is supply and demand, just like you'd expect from a market system. Markets simply are not efficient enough for the changes in productivity you're talking about to have impacts on salaries in the middle of very large company. Of course they effect all kinds of things like health of company etc etc as I've said but what I'm objecting to is statements like these:

>employers have to compete for your productivity your salary will increase. When you make an employer 10 bucks more an hour than the average worker in your field a different employer will have a strong incentive to hire you away. This puts pressure on your current employer to raise your wage.

The fact that employers have to compete for employees is true of course. But the idea that another employer is going to offer me a marginal increase in pay because they think I will provide a marginal increase in productivity is just silly. That calculation is too complex and with too wide error bars for the employer to bother with it (remember that there are costs and assumptions involved in doing these calculations). Thus salaries are sticky, markets are not going be able to affect my salary with the kind of efficiency you need to make this argument really work.

For the record, I'm not an anti-capitalist. But markets, just like every system, work better in some places than others, and they do not have the power that you're ascribing to them. The system is too complex, calculation costs are too high. Markets are sometimes efficient (in the technical sense of efficient markets), but they're not here.",progressive,1,1471349478.0,comment

dborkjm,"In my opinion, I think what lost it for Clinton was that she was portrayed as the ""status quo"" candidate; problem is, status quo for the Rust Belt states, PA, MI, and WI, would, for the most part, be a continued lack of jobs and poverty that they've struggled with since the decline of manufacturing jobs there. As much as I hate Trump, he promised to protect American industry and promised ""tremendous jobs"" for the Rust Belters. Even with everything else Trump has done, when you're in a situation where you are struggling with being unable to find a job you once had alongside many others in your region, not to mention high crime rates and drug usage in towns such as Gary, Indiana, what are you going to vote for; a candidate that largely seems to promise the continuation of the status quo - in other words, your poverty, or someone that promises to bring jobs back to the country. Mike Moore said it better than I ever could [here](http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/):

>I believe Trump is going to focus much of his attention on the four blue states in the rustbelt of the upper Great Lakes – Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Four traditionally Democratic states – but each of them have elected a Republican governor since 2010 (only Pennsylvania has now finally elected a Democrat). In the Michigan primary in March, more Michiganders came out to vote for the Republicans (1.32 million) that the Democrats (1.19 million). Trump is ahead of Hillary in the latest polls in Pennsylvania and tied with her in Ohio. Tied? How can the race be this close after everything Trump has said and done? Well maybe it’s because he’s said (correctly) that the Clintons’ support of NAFTA helped to destroy the industrial states of the Upper Midwest. Trump is going to hammer Clinton on this and her support of TPP and other trade policies that have royally screwed the people of these four states. When Trump stood in the shadow of a Ford Motor factory during the Michigan primary, he threatened the corporation that if they did indeed go ahead with their planned closure of that factory and move it to Mexico, he would slap a 35% tariff on any Mexican-built cars shipped back to the United States. It was sweet, sweet music to the ears of the working class of Michigan, and when he tossed in his threat to Apple that he would force them to stop making their iPhones in China and build them here in America, well, hearts swooned and Trump walked away with a big victory that should have gone to the governor next-door, John Kasich.
From Green Bay to Pittsburgh, this, my friends, is the middle of England – broken, depressed, struggling, the smokestacks strewn across the countryside with the carcass of what we use to call the Middle Class. Angry, embittered working (and nonworking) people who were lied to by the trickle-down of Reagan and abandoned by Democrats who still try to talk a good line but are really just looking forward to rub one out with a lobbyist from Goldman Sachs who’ll write them nice big check before leaving the room. What happened in the UK with Brexit is going to happen here. Elmer Gantry shows up looking like Boris Johnson and just says whatever shit he can make up to convince the masses that this is their chance! To stick to ALL of them, all who wrecked their American Dream! And now The Outsider, Donald Trump, has arrived to clean house! You don’t have to agree with him! You don’t even have to like him! He is your personal Molotov cocktail to throw right into the center of the bastards who did this to you! SEND A MESSAGE! TRUMP IS YOUR MESSENGER!

Don't get me wrong; I abhor Trump and I think Clinton would've been a better president by far. However, when one is struggling with poverty and are choosing between a guy who says he'll bring jobs back (and who knows, maybe he actually will) and a gal that largely promises a continuation of what's going on now, them not caring about who he is suddenly seems much more understandable.

>***“Alt-Right” Assassin Killed Six At Quebec Mosque***

>Alexandre Bissonnette killed six people at a Quebec City mosque on January 29. As the BBC reported, political science professor Pierre Martin “says that Bissonette may have been influenced by a mix of global nationalist trends, the so-called ‘alt-right’, and ‘currents within Quebec itself’.” Bissonette was reportedly known to many as a “right-wing ‘troll’ who had previously been combative” online “and also openly shared attacks on women’s rights” -- another trademark of the “alt-right.”

>***Dylann Roof, “Face Of The Radicalized ‘Alt-Right’” Killed Nine At Historically Black Church***

>The University of Chicago’s Divinity School properly identified Dylann Roof, the man behind the June 17, 2015, shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, SC, as “the face of the radicalized ‘alt-right.’” In a confession video, Roof told an FBI agent that he committed the attack because “Blacks are raping and killing white people on the streets every day.”

>According to The Daily Beast, “whole passages from Roof’s manifesto first appeared” on the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer. The Daily Beast pointed out, “The parallels between Roof’s manifesto and the comments on The Daily Stormer … suggest that either Roof was the commenter or he visited the site often enough to have plagiarized from it for his manifesto.”

>Wired reported that Roof “searched for ‘black on white crime’ and ended up on the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens’ website,” which The Atlantic said has its roots in an organization that “aimed to be a (somewhat) more respectable alternative” to the Ku Klux Klan.

>***British “White Fascist” Killed Labour MP Jo Cox***

>Thomas Mair, a British man “with extreme right wing views,” according to CNN, was convicted of murdering British Labour member of parliament Jo Cox in June 2016. According to The Independent, “Reports from the trial proceedings conjure up a profile of a committed right-wing terrorist extremist, with the court hearing details of Mair’s links to white supremacist groups and witness testimony to his exhortations to ‘put Britain First.’” The article went on to say the murder was “an act of political terrorism murder committed by a white fascist.” The Daily Mail reported that jurors in the case were shown the inside of Mair’s home, where he “plotted her murder amongst far-Right literature and a dossier on the MP.”

>***Man Angered By Debunked Sting Videos Killed Three At Colorado Planned Parenthood***

>In 2015, Robert Lewis Dear opened fire inside a Colorado Planned Parenthood, killing three people. As Vox noted, when he was arrested Dear mentioned “baby parts,” which was “probably a reference” to the deceptively edited videos meant to slander Planned Parenthood put out by the Center for Medical Progress, which were laden with conservative misinformation. New Republic pointed out that “the narratives he learned from Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones and Bill O’Reilly and countless far-right web sites” contributed to his radicalization and his murders.

>***White Supremacist Gave Nazi Salute After Targeting Jews In Missouri Shooting***

>Frazier Glenn Miller, a “Missouri man with a long resume of anti-Semitism and white supremacist activism,” according to CNN, killed three people on April 13, 2014, after opening fire on two Jewish centers in Kansas City, MO. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said that just after his arrest, “Miller shouted ‘Heil Hitler’ while handcuffed in the back seat of a police car.” The Kansas City Star also reported that Miller asked the officer, “How many f------ Jews did I kill?” After his arrest, Miller said he “wanted to make damned sure I killed some Jews or attacked the Jews before I died.”

>Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino, told CNN that Miller was “among the most-over-the-top, violent white supremacists” of the 1980s, adding that he “was one of the pioneers in the modern hate world.”

d5gdz1y,"> And there's nothing humorous about it,

First off where is this humor you speak of? I certainly see no humor in it.

> fact of the matter is he matched the description after giving one of Castile to dispatch

Yes, also in the link you provided it states:

>""**The officer went as far as to describe Castile before he got out of the car fitting the description of that wanted suspect…**""

Bolding original. So why say this in bold while neglecting to mention the ""wide-set eyes"" was the *entirety* of the description provided to dispatch. On reason and one reason only. To imply (falsely) that this ""description"" was an actual full description of the suspected burglar. The burglary was even several days prior and in a different area.

>there was a weapon in clear sight

Your linked article actually tries to make a case that this gun was in his lap, but falls well short of actually making that case. If this was the case why then was the first order given to produce an ID. Rather than the “do not move” order that only came when he began complying with the original order to produce the ID? Let's look at the weasle wording of the article you linked.

>""Officer Yanez **ultimately** told Castile “do not move” and that he failed to comply with that order and that there was **apparently** a visible gun.""

Bolding mine. First weasel word was ""**ultimately**."" This was in effect a tacit admission that this order came only after being ordered to produce an ID. An order he was in the process of complying with when the second order, do not move, followed immediately with shots fired without any time to process. The second weasel word was ""**apparently**."" Which tacitly admits the gun in the lap is nothing more than conjecture.

This is a hack job, pure and simple.

My best guess is perhaps you are saying that somehow them knowing the robbery suspect is black is somehow relevant? Only, if that's the case, that misses my point altogether. My point is that as a matter of standard practice the cops do not even care how well a description matches. They only tend to throw it out as a pretext for making the stop they want to make regardless of cause. Hence the /s. My story was merely to illustrate how much they don't care that the description doesn't match, that they are going to use it for a pretext for a stop regardless.

Black lives are lost in scary amount in Chicago alone (the city I was referring to earlier) but because, it's for the most part, black on black crime BLM doesn't care, nobody does. Yes police actions/training needs work, but so does general crime in these low income areas, which unfortunately are mostly black. There's no major race issue, there's a class issue. These low income areas have to turn to crime to survive, there needs to a focus on fixing the economy to help communities be able to avoid the need to rob, or murder each other. That's what I believe needs priority. Because when I'm in Chicago during college all I see is this black man killed this one, and nobody blinks an eye, but when a cop kills a black person under questionable circumstances they're racist and monsters.

What this means is Trump already set in motion a lack of regulation that would strain or even cause the collapse of the ACA from lack of participation. So when Trump and GOP declare the ACA is collapsing they have put in place protections for those who violate the current law.

The significant gains in coverage since the passage of Obamacare have almost exclusively been people getting enrolled in medicaid, people getting significant subsidies to assist with buying private policies, and middle income people with pre-existing conditions who can now buy insurance at a reasonable rate.

You are buying into the Republican argument that there are a significant number of people out there with disposable income that are just choosing not to have insurance because of some personal preference or character flaw.  The reality the reason people don't have insurance for the most part is because it is a significant financial burden to them.  Most of the people who would be encouraged to buy insurance because of the penalty were already doing so before the law passed because people really do view health insurance as a necessity.  The people who weren't already buying health insurance before are likely in a situation where purchasing insurance involves a significant sacrifice to their standard of living.  The extra 600-700 dollars might be the difference of being able to see their family over the holidays or repair/replace a broken stove/refrigerator.

dff9den,"This is kind backing up the point I was making.

It's not like there isn't an intrinsic motivation to have health insurance for most people.  The problem with the individual mandate is that for the most part, people who can afford health insurance without significant financial stress already have health insurance. The people who don't already have health insurance are generally in that situation because it would require significant financial sacrifice to buy insurance.  That being the case it's not like the choice of spending money to get something or setting the money on fire.  It's the difference between paying a penalty so you have enough left over to see you family over the holidays or buying health insurance and missing out on that opportunity.

If the penalty were close to the cost of an insurance plan it wouldn't make a difference but if you're living mostly paycheck to paycheck it's not hard to see why a significant number of people would take that risk that they're the lucky 98% of people who would be paying more into the risk pool than they'd be getting out.",progressive,1,1490520138.0,comment

e1d32xx,"> Accosted by outraged citizens.

Outraged anti-Trump types.  Big difference.  I am unsure what the point of doing this is - I suspect most progressives are smart enough to know that doing this isn't, by itself, going to change policies, or force anyone to resign because they can't get a meal.

If it were happening in reverse, would it make you all reconsider your opinions, resign, or change your mind?

What it will do is allow Republicans to play martyr and further the narrative that, if indeed Donald Trump supports ""the common working man"" - refusal to serve him or his people is - by extension - refusing to serve ""the common man.""

I do not clutch my pearls in shock of rich, powerful politicians being denied a meal.

I do however doubt the basic sanity or wisdom of people who think this is a strategy which will forward the progressive agenda, any more than the comments from Maxine Waters or Peter Fonda are likely to do this.

All of these are theater which play to fellow travelers, but exactly how this leads to regime change remains unclear to me.

When you decide to do something like this, you take a very big thing that impacts a lot of people and you make it all about you and your little pantomime of principle.

If a bunch of business owners in MAGA hats refused to serve anyone left of center, or any of, I don't know, Bernie Sanders's people, and you were one of those people, would it give you serious pause?  Would it change your mind?

And come campaign time, would you or would you not use it as an example of the incivility of the other side?

I've seen comments before about how ""taking the high road"" doesn't work.  The problem with this is it has been probably, sometime before the Monica Lewinsky incident, since I have seen anyone attempt the high road.

Fortunately, I have no doubt that Trump fans will do the same ""big signal, zero impact"" things once we do have a regime change, and it will also, likely, have the opposite of the intended effect.

Do what you want but you get zero credit for it.  All this does is take a situation at make it all about you and ""look at me and my refusal to give a dude a pie.""

Expect all of these dumb Tweets and media statements to be used to smear all of the left in upcoming elections.

Perhaps it will not be enough to make a difference.

But if the election is anything like the last couple, it might be enough to just nudge it in the right direction.

Nothing I see coming from progressives looks anything like what worked in the past.  Has there been a single march which looked at or evoked the energy of the famous Selma to Montgomery march?  If so, I haven't seen it.

If I were interested in the status quo, I'd write this whole comment off as a concern troll and keep doing the same thing that everyone is doing and has been doing.

The moral values of secular humanism mirror those of christian humanism to a remarkable extent. There is no divide between the end result of objective secular morality and objective Christian morality as it relates to 99% of things. 

> They have friends that are gay, they have friends that are immigrants, they are exposed to many more different cultures and are becoming more empathetic to those that aren't like them. 

The exact same is true for majority of conservative christians? Seriously, this stereotyping of a group you engage in is scary. 

Also, contact with people of different ""cultures"" drives social distrust, like Putnam showed in Bowling Alone. The tolerant people of Vermont are so because they don't engage with anything foreign in 90-95% of their neighborhoods. The story is very different where there is more diversity. 

> You keep talking about birthrate but after losing 20% a generation to ""librul"" attrition that birth rate doesn't mean squat.

Actually it still matters a lot in relation to the birthrates of other groups. Even when losing people away from their religion, the people they lose are still more likely than not to remain conservative, like heritability estimates on political views such as border controls clearly show. And lets not get started on how women turn very conservative after starting a family.  

These people they lose are also less likely to have children. So again, all that is happening is natural selection. Ideas that lead to infertility die out with the people that hold to them. ",progressive,-1,1529974119.0,comment

To me that seems like an indicator that they cannot think independently. 

If anything has taught us in the past, it is that sometimes religion is wrong and regardless of the fact, religious people will deny until it becomes popular enough to believe in it comfortably or where they feel that they are not committing a sort of blasphemy. 
Ex. When it was proven that the earth revolved around the sun, thus, proving that after all earth is not the center of the universe, the Catholic Church denied it and kinda brought up conflict. 

Religion is good and some people need it. I agree that often times atheism leads to Nihilism, but most people that grow up in America have a pretty good moral compass. Therefor, we don't 'need' religion. Saying that is because of fear of what your book of religion says will happen when humanity turns its back on God.

I mean, people definitely dislike her because she's imposing her moral beliefs on others; but people *also* seem to dislike her because she's flaunting the law. Except that many of those people would justify flaunting the law in situations where they felt it was justified.

> If you were a government clerk and you took a biblical position on slavery, would you use whatever means were available to kidnap people and sell them into slavery? No?

From what I understand, the biblical position is that slavery should be allowed, not that slavery should be mandatory. No, in that hypothetical situation, I would not attempt to sell people into slavery, any more than a pro-gay-marriage person today attempts to force people to marry people of their own gender; I *would* probably attempt to slow down the progress of mandatory slave release paperwork, just like I'd expect a pro-gay-marriage person to attempt to slow down anti-gay-marriage legislation and bureaucracy.

> Would you expect anyone to support your re-enslavement of blacks? No?

If by ""re-enslavement of blacks"" you mean ""attempt to reintroduce slavery"", then obviously, yeah, if I thought it was morally important, I would. I have no doubt there are people in the world who are attempting to reintroduce slavery.

(Not very effectively, mind you.)

> So, basically your ""contentious objector"" argument falls flat on its face, because doing shitty people to other things isn't and should not be tolerated.

Obviously that's not the case since I don't agree with your conclusions.

Also, everyone defines ""shitty"" differently. Don't pretend your definition is objectively valid until you have proof.

There's no bright-line way to determine what's ""taking rights"" and what's ""giving rights"". Every major political change ends up forcing people to do things they may not want to, and every major political change gives people the right to do things they want to do. And honestly, it's almost not relevant; I bet I can name rights that we could give people that you'd be against, and rights we could take away from people that you'd be in favor of.

The important part here is that there's Person, and Person sees that Government did Bad Thing, and Person is using what power they have to slow or stop Bad Thing.

But you're ignoring the fact that there was Christian civil disobedience in the case of slavery and it was largely on the side of preserving the institution and afterward oppressing black Americans. There has also been Christian civil disobedience used in the effort to deny black Americans equal rights and preserve segregation. 

Your argument is that this Davis woman is comparable to someone who would fight against slavery, but the reality is that she would be a member of one of the groups I've just mentioned.

cvp6niq,"I think you're trying to restrict this so far down that there won't any examples. You're now requiring:

* A government agent
* Given orders that they don't want to carry out
* That apply to another group of people
* Who actually *do* want those orders carried out
* And have them later complimented for refusing to carry out the orders

I can certainly come up with examples of people who want things that we have now decided are against society's interests. (And we deny them those things, and congratulate ourselves for doing so.) I don't know of any case that intersects *every one of those situations* but I can certainly imagine such a thing occurring. It's not impossible, just, with that many requirements, very unlikely.

And honestly kind of unrelated to the situation; people are criticizing kim davis for, and I'll quote again, ""defying the rule of law"", not ""defying the rule of law as a government agent preventing people from acquiring something that they want and that the law offers them"". I haven't seen anyone on that particular side of the discussion saying that it would be totally OK for her to practice civil disobedience if she still had that same level of power but wasn't a government agent.

Again, I'm not saying I agree with her beliefs regarding gay marriage. But if the government passed a major law that massively infringed on some rights you felt were important, and there was someone in a government position who was slowing that infringement, then I suspect you'd be cheering them on, not demanding that they resign.

Seriously, imagine it's twenty years from now and Congress passes a law saying that all gay marriages must be revoked, and you're the person whose job is to do the paperwork; until you've done that job, the marriages are still active.

The thing Kim Davis is doing wrong is that she's on the wrong side of the issue. Nothing more and nothing less. This is a completely separate matter from whether she's fighting for her goals in a morally acceptable way. It's possible that someone is doing something we disapprove of, but doing it in a matter that we *would* approve of if we agreed with her, and I'll give Kim Davis credit here, that's exactly what she's doing.

You may be right about this. I tend to believe that we should be supporting people who aren't motivated by hate and jealousy, but standing up for one's beliefs can be viewed as a virtue. Though, I do think it's worth noting that you're supporting anarchy, but I'm sure you're well aware of that fact.

> “When you make heroes out of people who refuse to accept the rule of law and who fail to acknowledge the dignity of other human beings, you are on a very dangerous path.”

and I don't see anything regarding Kim's status as a government representative, nor do I see anything regarding Kim making judgments on laws that apply to other people, nor do I see anything regarding whether those people want those laws applied or not.

My point was that some people seem to be doing so, and they should not; the grounds to criticize Kim are on what goal she's pursuing, not the methods she's taking to pursue that goal, unless the claim really is that those methods are never acceptable. If you're not doing so then you're not doing the thing I'm talking about and so this entire conversation is kinda pointless :V",progressive,0,1444076028.0,comment
cvpb1cd,"> Which is why people with a misguided sense of ""morality"" should be treated as bigots. Because they are bigots.

Sure. Not saying otherwise.

I think people are operating under the delusion that I'm saying Kim Davis is a good person. I'm not saying that. I'm saying that she should be criticized for the bad stuff she's doing, and that we shouldn't be criticizing *every* action of hers simply because it's being done by a bad person.

Hitler made art. Doesn't mean art is evil.

> You can't say she's acting as an individual if her actions affect government's actions.

Sure I can. She's an individual, she's acting. In the end, all of our actions affect lots of organizations. The fact that her actions affect government's actions just mean that her actions are very influential. (Which, again, is why we're talking about it - nobody would be talking about it otherwise. In that sense she's been quite effective.)

> Except granted marriage licenses to more couples is an expansion of rights, not an infringement of rights. Even if you think that same-sex marriage is reprehensible, allowing other people to enter into such a marriage isn't infringing any of your rights, because you have nothing to do with it.

I don't see how this is relevant.

Here. I'll rephrase.

But if the government passed a major law that caused (INSERT SUPER-DUPER-BAD THING HERE), and there was someone in a government position who was slowing (INSERT SUPER-DUPER-BAD THING HERE), then I suspect you'd be cheering them on, not demanding that they resign.

Your objection, right now, is of the form ""yeah but Kim Davis is doing something *I don't like*, which is different from if she was doing something I liked"". No shit! But whether an action is a moral response to a situation doesn't depend on whether /u/joshm60 thinks that situation is bad, it depends on whether the actor thinks that situation is bad.

> Revoking marriages is a limitation of rights, while granting them is an expansion of rights. You can't compare someone who illegally stalls the expansion of rights to someone who illegally stalls the limitation of rights.

Apparently I can. And I am. In both cases, it's a person seeing something that they consider ""bad"", and trying to change it.

Hell, it's not even obvious whether something is a ""limitation of rights"" or ""expansion of rights"". If we were going by the strictest reading, Libertarians would be the most moral people on the planet.",progressive,-1,1444076945.0,comment

Yep, that's pretty much my approach. I don't think Kim Davis is in the right, but then, there's plenty of people I agree with that get tarred with that same motivated-by-hate brush. I can't justify cherrypicking my support of people's means based solely on my support of people's ends.

> Though, I do think it's worth noting that you're supporting anarchy, but I'm sure you're well aware of that fact.

Yeah. I feel like it's important to have a measure of chaos in the system; chaos is how things change, and without chaos, you end up with stagnation. It is virtually certain that we have not arrived at the Best Political System Possible, and it's equally certain that there's something we're doing right now that we're totally proud of and is *totally an awful idea*.

That doesn't mean we should tear down the whole thing and start from zero, which is why I don't end up getting along with most anarchists :V but it does mean that we should recognize when people are standing up for what *they* believe and give them, at the very least, enough rope to hang themselves, and enough of a voice to get shouted down.
