No, bitch. You lost because you're not fit to do a simple job. You are *unqualified* for the position you formerly filled. All you had to do was sign legal documentation that two individuals had entered into a consensual marriage under the guidelines of state legislation so their union would be recognized by the court. You didn't do that. You lost your job.

dhlrh8o,"McMaster's and Tillerson's statements don't contradict the article:

NSA McMaster's quote in article:

> ""The president and foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation.""

> ""At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.""

[Sec. State Tillerson:](https://twitter.com/jeffzeleny/status/864246607415529472)

> ""During President Trump's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov a broad range of subjects were discussed among which were common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism. During that exchange the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations.""



[Max Rosenthal (WaPo editor)](https://twitter.com/maxjrosenthal/status/864247660806623232)

> Wording is essentially the same as McMaster's, doesn't actually deny anything in our report.

From the article:

> Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.

-

> The identification of the location was seen as particularly problematic, officials said, because Russia could use that detail to help identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capability involved. Officials said the capability could be useful for other purposes, possibly providing intelligence on Russia’s presence in Syria. Moscow would be keenly interested in identifying that source and perhaps disrupting it.

-

> “Russia could identify our sources or techniques,” the senior U.S. official said.

-

So Trump didn't directly disclose sources or methods... but gave away enough info that the Russians could figure it out.",politics,44,1494888871.0,comment

>Two US officials who were briefed on Trump’s disclosures last week confirmed to BuzzFeed News the veracity of the Post report, with one official noting that “it’s far worse than what has already been reported.”

Keep in mind. Russian press was invited. American press was excluded. They probably had audio/video of this for a week over in the Kremlin. Our ""free"" press was kept in the dark until these leaks to WaPo.

Ok, one last edit - for the people telling me the WH/McMaster have denied and claimed it is false. McMaster just gave a 60 second press conference, denied sharing ""sources and methods,"" and left without taking any questions. WaPo didn't claim he gave ""sources and methods,"" it reported that he gave them the actual classified underlying Intel.

>He went on, “I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.”

>If he were writing “The Art of the Deal” today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title. Asked what he would call it, he answered, “The Sociopath.”

>And that is that it’s impossible to keep him focussed on any topic, other than his own self-aggrandizement, for more than a few minutes, and even then . . . ” Schwartz trailed off, shaking his head in amazement. He regards Trump’s inability to concentrate as alarming in a Presidential candidate. “If he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room, it’s impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time,” he said.

>But Schwartz believes that Trump’s short attention span has left him with “a stunning level of superficial knowledge and plain ignorance.” He said, “That’s why he so prefers TV as his first news source—information comes in easily digestible sound bites.”

> He added, “I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.” During the eighteen months that he observed Trump, Schwartz said, he never saw a book on Trump’s desk, or elsewhere in his office, or in his apartment.

>There was not a single call that Trump deemed too private for Schwartz to hear. “He loved the attention,” Schwartz recalls. “If he could have had three hundred thousand people listening in, he would have been even happier.”

>Lying is second nature to him,” Schwartz said. “More than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least ought to be true.” 

>Schwartz wrote, “Trump stands for many of the things I abhor: his willingness to run over people, the gaudy, tacky, gigantic obsessions, the absolute lack of interest in anything beyond power and money.”

>Schwartz says of Trump, “He’d like people when they were helpful, and turn on them when they weren’t. It wasn’t personal. He’s a transactional man—it was all about what you could do for him.”

>If Trump is elected President, he warned, “the millions of people who voted for him and believe that he represents their interests will learn what anyone who deals closely with him already knows—that he couldn’t care less about them.”

Sure, apologizing to other countries is really just a gesture to say I don't agree with or support our current administration or what they're doing.

But what I am really sorry for is my naivety in ever thinking that I and my country are better than others, that Americas humans are better than humans from other countries.

I'm sorry for thinking that racism was no longer as big a deal as it was in the 50's and 60's.  I'm sorry for thinking women were now considered equals to men.  I'm sorry for believing we as a majority embraced those who are different.

If McGahn testified that he refused the order because it was obstruction (since people in the chain of command are allowed to resist illegal orders) then Trump would still be guilty of obstruction. Obstruction does not have to be ""successful"". It merely had to have been attempted, with purpose.

Here is a detailed timeline


1. Nixon orders Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to fire special counsel Archibald Cox, they refuse and resign.
2. Nixon orders acting AG Bork to fire Cox, Bork does so (but he too resigns later)
3. Federal court rules firing Cox was obstruction of justice.

dt95451,"Okay, I'll post this long thread written by Seth Abramson:

>**(THREAD) BREAKING NEWS (New York Times)**: We now know Trump already tried to fire Special Counsel Mueller—7 months ago. Many believed such an attempt would be a ""red line"" that would lead to impeachment. So what do we do now? I analyze that question and what this news means here.

>**1/** First, here's the NYT story. The upshot is that last June Donald Trump *ordered* White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller. McGahn refused and threatened to quit if Trump went forward with the firing. Ultimately, Trump relented.

>**2/** Some will wonder why McGahn had enough sway with Trump to stop this from happening. That's a very good question to ask. First, note that McGahn was the attorney from Trump's winning presidential campaign, so the two have known each other and worked together for some time now.

>**3/** Next, we have to remember that McGahn is a potential witness—and, importantly, a potential witness *against Trump*—in the Trump-Russia investigation. McGahn was present at nearly all the key moments in the Obstruction fact-pattern that Mueller is considering referring to DOJ.

>**4/** If Mueller refers an Obstruction indictment to DOJ, DOJ will likely refer it to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration for articles of impeachment—and whether or not such articles come out of that committee, America already knows Obstruction is an impeachable offense.

>**5/** It's an impeachable offense because it already was for Bill Clinton—per the Republican Party and its votes on impeachment in the House. So while Trump may only have had an inkling of this last June, he likely knew enough to see that McGahn was someone whose loyalty he needed.

>**6/** McGahn is protected from ever testifying against Donald Trump on some issues—but *not* if the conduct he is to be questioned about involves criminal conduct by the president. Remember that Don McGahn does *not* represent Donald Trump, he represents the Office of the President.

>**7/** Definitionally and legally, criminal conduct is not considered within the recognized duties of a president, which means McGahn's role as an attorney for the Office of the President diverges from Trump's own legal interests as and when the president has acted illegally—as here.

>**8/** McGahn was present before and after the Comey firing, as Trump concocted pretexts for that illegal action and then—afterward—a coverup for what was a *Russia-based* decision to dump Comey. That decision was illegal for the previously cited reason about the office of president.

>**9/** No constitutional provision or U.S. statute ever has—or ever could—authorize POTUS to commit a crime. This means that while Trump *is* allowed to fire Comey because, say, he doesn't like Comey's dress sense, he's *not* allowed to fire him to obstruct a criminal investigation.

>**10/** So McGahn can rather readily be used as an Obstruction witness against Trump, not just because of the Comey firing but much else—for instance attempts to pressure Congressional investigators to drop their probes or attempts to pressure Jeff Sessions into not recusing himself.

>**11/** Trump was represented by Marc Kasowitz last June, and either Trump or Kasowitz would have sussed out that if Don McGahn quit the White House because he believed Trump was about to commit a *crime*—and make no mistake, that'd pretty much be the basis—it would be a catastrophe.

>**12/** The firing itself would be a catastrophe politically, but if it occurred concurrent to McGahn quitting, the chances that McGahn would be drawn even further into the investigation as a witness against Trump would be *extremely* high. And we don't know what *else* McGahn knows.

>**13/** Here's the problem: Trump didn't back off from firing Mueller because he decided it was wrong or outside his authority or—better still—a federal crime. 

>This is a *critical* point: the NYT establishes Trump *only* relented to keep McGahn from quitting as White House Counsel.

>**14/** Indeed, there wouldn't have been any story for the NYT to report—this would likely never have leaked—if Trump had simply gone to McGahn for legal advice about firing Mueller, and McGahn had advised him not to do so, and Trump immediately relented in the face of such advice.

>**15/** Rather, the NYT says that—either on his own counsel or someone else's—Donald Trump *ordered* McGahn to do something. He did *not* ask for his advice, he *ordered* him to fire Mueller. (It may have been Kasowitz's doing, as Kasowitz was urging Trump to go to war with Mueller.)

>**16/** So what we know now is Trump had the criminal intent—mens rea—to Obstruct by firing his *second* person who was then investigating him, but no crime occurred because there was no actus reus (no act). The only reason there was no act was a key witness threatening to jump ship.

>**17/** So Trump thinks he has the *authority* to fire Mueller, that doing so is *appropriate* and *warranted*, and he has the *willingness* to do so. Also (lest we forget) he has the willingness to *lie* about wanting to fire Mueller—as he's now been lying about it for seven months.

>**18/** When many many analysts, me included, were saying after Mueller's appointment that he needed to be protected ASAP from Trump firing him—because we said that that attempt *would* be made—such concerns were dismissed as conspiracy theory and the bill to protect Mueller stalled.

>**19/** One effect of this breaking news therefore must be immediate passage of the bill to protect Mueller that was *only* not passed previously because the GOP told America—and they were dead wrong—that this president never had and would never have any intention of firing Mueller.

>**20/** But it's more than that: Trump was willing to fire Mueller when his level of legal jeopardy was unclear, and Mueller had brought *no* indictments and secured *no* cooperation deals with top Trump national security aides. So what is Trump's temperature on firing Mueller *now*?

>**CONCLUSION/** This is the last moment for Republicans to jump off the Trump ship in the eyes of history. Trump is the Titanic and the iceberg is *dead ahead*. He *will* try to fire Mueller—a crime and impeachable as Obstruction. Congress must get on the right side of history *now*.

>**NOTE/** There are other ancillary effects to this story: for instance, Bill Burck *must* now see that he needs to get the hell off two of the three cases he's currently working as attorney: Bannon, McGahn, and Priebus. Representing all three is no longer (really never was) tenable.

My take on all this is that Mueller already has Trump cold on obstruction charges.   When the questioning happens, I'm sure that Mr. Mueller will make it abundantly clear that any future attempts to interfere in his investigation will result in obstruction indictments being filed.    

Trump is becoming increasingly worried about Mueller.   The next couple of weeks are going to be interesting to watch as the noose tightens.

",politics,9479,1516930688.0,comment
dt90z3v,">WASHINGTON — **President Trump ordered the firing last June of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation**, according to four people told of the matter, but ultimately backed down after the **White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.**

>The West Wing confrontation marks the first time Mr. Trump is known to have tried to fire the special counsel. Mr. Mueller learned about the episode in recent months as his investigators interviewed current and former senior White House officials in his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

>Amid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case, **the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation**, two of the people said.

> **First, he claimed that a dispute years ago over fees at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., had prompted Mr. Mueller, the F.B.I. director at the time, to resign his membership.** The president also said Mr. Mueller could not be impartial because he had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Finally, the president said, Mr. Mueller had been interviewed to return as the F.B.I. director the day before he was appointed special counsel in May.

Two things are abundantly clear from this quoted section. The first, is that Donald Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice, and of obstructing the investigation into his obstruction of justice. u/Picture_me_this has [created a helpful infographic](https://imgflip.com/i/23dh8v) explaining this.

The second is, that he is an idiot child. Because he thinks a dispute over golf fees from years ago disqualifies a former FBI director and later prestigious law partner from running an investigation.

Also, seriously, that final reason is so stupid. Hey, we thought the guy might be competent enough to run the entire FBI, no way he can run a single investigation!

Edit - Since this is a visible comment, this seems like an appropriate time to remind everyone: **if he fires Mueller, get to the streets and stay there until he is reinstated or Trump is impeached**.

[Trump confidant: ‘I think he’s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel’ *PBS Newshour, Jun 12, 2017*](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-confidant-think-hes-considering-perhaps-terminating-special-counsel)

He parrots two out of three of Trump's justifications outlined by this New York Times article. From that video:

>**There’s some real conflicts, he comes from a law firm that represents members of the Trump family. He interviewed the day before, a few days before, he was appointed special counsel, with the president, who was looking at him potentially to become the next FBI Director. That hasn’t been published, but it’s true.** And I think it would be strange that he would have a confidential conversation and then a few days later become the prosecutor of the person he may be investigating.

dt932c5,"This, this right here, is important. As more and more evidence comes out that incriminates Trump, his fellow Republicans are going to try and discredit those involved in the investigation. Two thoughts:

1. It proves that they [the other Republicans] actually believe that Trump is guilty and that they have no confidence in him. If they truly believed he was innocent, why wouldn't they just defend him instead of going on a smear campaign? They know something big (and more importantly, provable) is coming and are doing their best to delegitimize it before it happens.

2. Getting rid of Mueller solely by discrediting him is very unlikely and is probably not the goal. The goal I think is to craft a narrative to Trump supporters that casts the Special Counsel as a biased operative out to take down their President. And it's working already; not only do they completely distrust the media, but they're also starting to distrust the Intelligence Community as well. This is very dangerous, and I think this will have implications that last far beyond this investigation. They're essentially crafting an entire demographic that listens to *them* and *them only*.

# (the worst, believe me) TIMELINE of Events Between Comey Firing And Mueller ""Firing""

####(credit to Bill Moyers, NPR, WaPo and NYT for original research. Go be a patriot, buy a newspaper.)

- May 6-7 - Trump at Bedminster. According to Wolff, convinced by Kushner to fire Comey.

- May 8 - Trump meets Rosenstein + Sessions, Rosenstein begins drafting Comey excuse letter. Also May 8 - Yates testifies to Congress.

- **May 9 - Comey fired.** ""The Long Fortnight"" begins.

- May 10 - Trump-Russians meeting at WH (""Comey's a nutjob, pressure's off now."") Rosenstein phones McGahn and demands WH corrects public impression that Rosenstein initiated Comey firing.

- May 11 - Trump interviewed by Lester Holt to bat down growing public reaction to firing, but contradicts the excuse memo, calls out ""made up Russia investigation"" as a reason for firing, and says he would have fired without Rosenstein memo.

- May 12 - Trump subtweets Comey with ""Better hope there aren't tapes""

- May 16 - Comey reveals existence of contemporaneous memos about Trump's line-crossing behavior. Mueller interviewed for FBI chief.

- **May 17 - Rosenstein appoints Mueller without warning, blindsiding White House**

- May 19 - Senate says Comey will testify publicly

- May 22 - Flynn pleads 5th to Senate Intel 

- May 26 - First reporting of Kushner-Kislyak ""back channel"" attempt

- May 27 - additional reporting reveals other, not-disclosed Kush-Kis meetings

- May 31 - Flynn and Cohen receive subpoenas. Nunes issues dueling ""unmasking"" related subpoenas.

- **June 2 - Mueller assumes control of Comey investigation resources. i.e. ""day one"" of Mueller on his new job.**

- June 7 + 8 - Comey releases account of contemporaneous memo & testifies to Congress about it. Trump tweets ""vindication"" and calls Comey ""a leaker.""

- June 9 thru 11 - **Trump is at NY resort, golfing over weekend. Did McGahn accompany him?** Otherwise we can possibly eliminate these days.

- [**June 12 - RUMORS SWIRL IN MEDIA ABOUT TRUMP ""CONSIDERING"" FIRING MUELLER. One source was Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, one of Trump's dial-up confidants. These rumors now look like the aftermath of a real firing attempt.**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-confidant-think-hes-considering-perhaps-terminating-special-counsel)

- June 13 - [TRUMP LAUNCHES TWITTER ATTACK ON FORMER AG LYNCH](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-06-13/donald-trump-launches-twitter-attack-against-former-attorney-general-loretta-lynch) tweeting that she ""made law enforcement decisions for political purposes... gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection"". Rosenstein says publicly no reason to fire Mueller. **Reading between lines - Trump lashing out here at Sessions/Rosenstein for not being ""protectors"" - did Trump also experience pushback from them? Could be more to this attempted-firing story than McGahn...** In either case, this tweet is also something to re-evaluate in the light of new media reports. By the way, around this time Sarah Huckabee Sanders holds a presser denying that the President had even considered (much less attempted) to fire Mueller - so, you know, one more gold star for her in everyone's credibility book right?

- June 15 - Mueller begins requesting interviews with senior WH staff. Media speculates an OOJ investigation, Trump tweets **""the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history, led by some very bad and conflicted people!""** The witch-hunt tweet makes waves, if I recall accurately, because it was Trump's first public comment on Mueller.

- June 23 - POLITICO publishes a [""Trump loses patience with McGahn""](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/23/trump-don-mcgahn-white-house-counsel-russia-239876) headline, recounting a meeting ""at the beginning of the week"" (that would presumably be the 19th): **Trump started the week by giving McGahn a dressing down in the Oval Office for not doing more to quash the Russia probe early on.** Another news story that looks interestingly different in hindsight.


------

So.... Using the news archives, I think we can narrow this new Trump-tried-to-fire-Mueller story down to a relatively narrow window in June - **later than June 2 and no later than June 11.** It looks like both the Ruddy interview and the Loretta Lynch tweet are taking place in the ""Aftermath"" of Trump's failed beta-boss showdown with McGahn, and the June 15 ""Witch Hunt"" tweet is his attempt to take control politically since just ordering his firing has failed.

In other words... if Trump tried to fire Mueller between June 2 and June 11, 

#**Trump tried to fire Mueller in his first or second week on the job.**

# This is consciousness of guilt. Mueller didn't do a damn thing in between taking over the investigations and being almost fired. Mueller had to be fired for the same reason Comey had to be fired: Trump knows he is guilty.",politics,2595,1516931294.0,comment

Well you're not entirely wrong.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258655569458651136

>I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented. Millions of truckloads of this incredible fire-proofing material were taken to special “dump sites” and asbestos was replaced by materials that were supposedly safe but couldn’t hold a candle to asbestos in limiting the ravages of fire.

My dad is constantly complaining about how ""you millennials"" don't have any critical thinking skills.

A couple months ago our local grocery store had a sale on. Mix and match select items in multiples of 10 to get a big discount.

My dad had 15 items picked out, so I asked if he wanted to get 5 more and he acted like I was speaking a different language. Turns out he doesn't know what a multiple is. 

No problem, right? It's simple. I said ""you buy one group of 10, you get a discount. You buy a second group of 10, that's discounted too. If we get 15 items, only 10 get the discount.""

""I don't get it. You figure it out."" 

He flat out refused to even _try_ to understand.

And then on the way out, he said ""they probably made it confusing on purpose. They know the Mexicans won't understand it and they'll end up spending more money.""

This is one of the areas where you couldn't get a republican base member to say you're wrong and the dems never used that power to make sure it got done.

As long as we have a society that so openly rewards sociopathy this will never stop. The people with the least shame will continually rise to the top to exploit those beneath them. 

You can point out how monstrous these people are until you're blue in the face, but that won't stop them from spinning their propaganda and making people believe what they want them to believe. 

The only way to stop these monsters is to hit them in one of two places they can actually feel it, their wallet and their necks. You have to dismantle the flow of capital to these people or chop their god damned heads off, nothing else will stop them.

Couldn't agree more. He's intelligent, well-spoken, fearless, AND he has a good heart. It's so rare to see someone who's strong enough to put themselves in the spotlight to stand up and fight for others, not for profit or glory or fame, but just to truly help people who need it. He's an incredible human being. And the sad part is, he shouldn't have to do this at all, because it's f\*cking ridiculous that our 9/11 heroes aren't given financial and healthcare support after *everything* they have done for this country.

Since the First Responders were working in the smouldering rubble all day every day for months afterwards, they breathed in tons of those toxins, and within a few years they started to get sick.

The First Responders Bill would pay to cover their health care for these diseases. Should be the easiest bill to pass in the world, right? Wrong. Instead, it's been treated as a political football for two decades now. 

Usually what happens is someone (*cough Mitch McConnell cough*) adds a controversial amendment, or attaches it as an amendment to a controversial bill. (For example, maybe the amendment would repeal environmental regulations, or limit abortion access nationwide, or other partisan bullshit.) This forces moderate politicians to vote against it, and then McConnell can turn around and say ""look at all these moderate politicians who voted against the 9/11 First Reponsders bill! They're evil, and should be voted out of office!""

eqscamm,"Sadly, racial bluster. I have an aunt and two uncles who were 9/11 first responders. Two were NYPD, the other was a security manager in Building 7 (not for the building itself, his office was just there). All three lost coworkers and close friends that day, NYPD and FDNY who were still inside the towers when they fell. My aunt and uncles were in the rubble that same day and in the subsequent weeks, looking for bodies. Thankfully, none of them got any health problems from their efforts.

And yet, all three of them are hardcore Republicsns. The types who are still boycotting watching the NFL because they didn't ban players who kneeled during the national anthem. Because they thought it was disrepctful to their friends who died on 9/11.

The irony of it all is completely lost on them. At least some of their coworkers and friends would have lived had NYC Republican Mayor Juliani approved funding for radio infrastructure upgrades that would have allowed radio transmissions to be carried from outside to inside buildings (i forget what the system is called). But Juliani is still their hero.

Some of their coworkers and friends who subsequently died from illness and disease as a result of their presence that day and later days would still be alive if Republicans didn't fight damn near every funding bill that would have provided for their care. 

But they still vote Republican and villify ""liberals"", Democrats, and ""minorities"".

They proudly fly ""Thin Blue Line"" flags outside their houses and have the bumper stickers on their car. And while the ""Thin Blue Line"" flag predates the whole NFL kneeling stuff, they never flew the flag or had the bumper sticker before that.

They complain endlessly about how ""minorities"" are coddled by the state. About how black people in America are, ""Still crying about slavery."" They say they don't hate minorities, they, ""Just don't trust the ones in the hoods and ghettos.""

One wonders what their priorities are, what their values are. I'm close with my family, and I love them very much. I don't think they're inherently bad people, just brainwashed. But I can't respect their beliefs or their actions, voting Republican, when they simultaneously bemoan how poorly their friends and coworkers were treated post 9/11, that they couldn't get sufficient health coverage. And, in a way, this does mean that I don't fully respect them, either.

It's a hard thing to admit, because I do love them. But, they can't see past their own biases that the only people that seem to be fighting for them in the political arena are the ones they despise the most. And they can't see that protesting systemic racial injustice is not the same as hating law enforcement.

The ""Blue lives matter"" stuff is just racial bluster. They don't seem to notice that the lives of their Blue friends and coworkers *don't* matter to the political party they've allied themselves with. They're just political props for Republicans, just as they were as ""heroes of 9/11"".

It's hard, because 18 years and a few wars and natural disasters later, memories are starting to go sepia toned, especially if you and your circle weren't affected by it directly.  And I get that, it's part of the healing process and that's okay.

eqscdqe,"I'm just so tired of the daily absurdity of the Republican party. This shit has been old for two decades. Anyone remotely associating with them I deem completely ignorant.

How can the party of supposed Christian Family and patriotism and supportive of troops and having little yellow-ribbons on their suburban be so quick to defend and support a party who continues to prop up Trump who has:

- Insulted Gold Star families (parents of soldiers who ""died fighting for freedom."")
- Insults POW war heroes and dodges the draft himself

And a party who doesn't even fucking support the 9/11 Rescuers despite them touting, ""Never Forget"" every moment when it's politically-expedient.

If you in any way support the Republican party and this President, know that I utterly despise you—and I think for good reason:

------------
I'll just leave this here: 

[Conservatives don't believe empathy and tolerance are important virtues to instill in their children (that's a bit concerning; I thought they were the party of Jesus, hmm....).](https://www.people-press.org/2014/09/18/how-is-ideology-linked-to-child-rearing-values/)

Liberals believe it is important to teach Children:

- Curiosity
- Empathy
- Tolerance

Whereas Conservatives believe it's important to teach:

- Obedience
- Faith

It's right here where you see the divide being sown. Empathy—a high-level emotion—needs to be fostered and learned just like any high-level logic techniques. If the mother and/or father fails in doing this, it leads to long-term issues. [Teachers have also widely called for bolstering teaching empathy:](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/17/497827991/a-sesame-study-in-kindness)

>How can a child be kind without being helpful or thoughtful? By being polite. It turns out that manners were very important to parents. When given a choice between having manners and having empathy and asked, ""Which of these is more important for your child to be right now?"" 58 percent chose manners compared with just 41 percent who chose empathy.

>Kotler Clarke suggests that some parents may assume that teaching a child manners is a good way of building empathy. But, she says, ""**There's really no great evidence around that. In fact, bullies are very good at having manners around adults.**""

>On this point, teachers broke with parents, overwhelmingly preferring empathy (63 percent) over manners (37 percent). And teachers can see the disconnect in their classrooms. Thirty-four percent say, of the children they teach, that all or most of their parents are raising kids to be empathetic and kind, while just 30 percent say all or most parents are raising children with values consistent with their teachers'.

eqsml8k,"> The night that his final episode aired was also the night of one of the first (maybe THE first?) GOP debates for the 2016 election.

This is correct: the series finale of *The Daily Show with Jon Stewart* was August 6, 2015. Literally *just* before that episode began, [the first Republican presidential debate (among the then-highest polling candidates) of the 2016 campaign season concluded on Fox News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Republican_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums#August_6,_2015_%E2%80%93_Cleveland,_Ohio).

The entire finale was remarkable, reminding me a couple of times that it's often more emotionally powerful to watch a man trying *not* to cry than to watch one who's crying. As an aside, another such example of that principle is given by [Jon's return to the show immediately after 9/11](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/1q93jy/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-september-11--2001)—something having new resonance now in the context of Jon's initial recognition of the first responders.

---

From the finale, I'd also recommend the segments with [Stephen Colbert's farewell](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/bjutn7/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-a-send-off-from-stephen-colbert) and Jon's [warning to Camera 3 that still feels very, very relevant today (*barely*-NSFW language)](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ss6u07/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-uncensored---three-different-kinds-of-bulls--t):

I was at RTC Great Lakes for Navy Recruit training and happened to see the second plane hit on the TVs in the infirmary. After watching for a minute, I rushed back to our barracks with the medical record I had gone to pick up. 

Within the hour our Chief and Petty Officers pulled us together and told us that we had been attacked and to be prepared for the fact that we were going to war. The base was on lock down for the rest of the time I was there. We got prepared and our division came together with a pretty keen sense of purpose. 

I remember post training people would thank me for being in the service. At the time, I thought it was strange people would want to thank me and give me stuff just for being in uniform. I hadn’t done anything.

It took me a while to realize that they weren’t thanking me specifically because of what I had, or hadn’t, done. They were thanking me because of what you had done.

But as I started pulling my head out of the sand, I realized that none of that was being represented. 

Conservatives love talking about ""freeloaders"" taking government handouts, yet the 1% enjoys the largest portion of government handouts. They love saying how the lower class is ""lazy"" and ""uneducated"". I missed how working two jobs on minimum wage to afford to go to school and live a decent life is lazy, and asking for a higher minimum wage is just asking for a handout when corporate profits are at an all time high and underemployment is also at an all time high.

They talk about how abortions is about killing ""babies"", but don't worry, euthanizing brain dead adults is perfectly fine and legal.

They say that when you go to college you'll become ""a liberal snowflake.""

The problem isn't anything but american obsession with money.

In the US there is a certain.... culture, for lack of a better word. Ask almost any american what they think the main purpose of any business is, and >90% (my guess) will say it's to make money.

eqs8uve,"Here's why. 

""Protect our oceans"" sure sounds like a good thing to do right? But Missouri's representatives don't care. They're not on an ocean, most of the constituents are unlikely to ever be on an ocean, if they eat fish regularly it's almost certainly freshwater cod from a major inland river.  Coastal states alone done have a majority. 

""Protect the Mississippi"" sure sounds like a good thing to do right? But only a few states border the Mississippi River and most people not from those states are unlikely to do anything other than drive or fly over it, and they almost certainly aren't too concerned about how clean it is, because they're getting their fish from local rivers or oceans, as the case may be. 

So the reps in favor of A talk to the reps in favor of B and put together a combined bill, and now its got a majority to pass. 


Now replace B with ""protect our grazing land"". Still seems reasonable to combine right? 

Now replace B with ""protect our teacher's pensions"". (Hey it's all livelihood stuff right?) 

Now replace B with ""protect coal mining"" (still livelihood and cheaper than the teachers), still worth passing right? Oceans are super important if you're from Massachusetts or Florida after all. 

Letting unrelated things be in the same bill is a way to horse trade to build a majority out of issues that aren't important enough to enough people to pass on their own. 

The tragedy here isn't that we allow legislation with multiple purposes, it's that apparently ""health of people who are sick due to a national tragedy"" isn't popular enough to get a clean run.",politics,602,1560279365.0,comment

eqs67sv,"I’m with you.

I don’t think “celebrities” should run for office based solely on their ”celebrity”, I think when these candidates throw their hat in that’s its a joke. A hijacking of the political process as some vanity exercise or a failure to acknowledge the gravity and importance of public office.

But Jon isn’t that guy. 

Jon is the guy that nine days after 9/11 coaxed a 13 year old me and definitely many many more out from under the blankets and told us we’re stronger than what had happened - stronger than what I saw and smelt wafting down through my NJ town after the towers fell. 

Jon is the guy that under the guise of a jester’s hat made generations of young Americans not only understand the fucked up machinations of our politics but trust in the fact we could change them. 

Jon is the guy that saw those heroes - and I don’t throw that term “heroes” around like so many others in our society - those **heroes** who ran into the fire and later the twisted, toxic and smoldering steel of those fallen great buildings and used his voice to amplify theirs towards a government that paid them only lip service. First to joke then cajole then to scream at those in government who **do** bandy the term “hero” at every politically opportune moment and shame them publicly for their total abdication of responsibility. 

Jon’s a regular guy now, he left the Daily Show four fucking years ago and he is still that booming voice for the men and women who got their death sentence in that pile yet are still here shuffling towards a painful death.

Jon isn’t a just a comedian, he isn’t just a journalist, he’s a voice of conscience for this entire nation - and if not the entire nation than sure as fuck my generation. I don’t “revere” many people but I do revere Jon Stewart and if he ever left the farm and ran for public office I’d drop whatever I was doing and knock on a hell of a lot of doors for him.

I wasn’t shocked by this speech, I wasn’t surprised by his eloquence and passion; all I could think after was:

The whole anti Muslim movement could have been curtailed if the focus was put on Wahhabism, the sect of Islam most responsible for terrorist attacks. Saudi Arabia has been building Wahhabist mosques throughout the world since the 1970's in order to exert their influence.

eqt3zvr,"This is purely anecdotal but a lot of people who I know who have changed their personal ideologies tend to move left vs right. I live in a generally rural area so there are a lot more conservative people here, so I can imagine that it could just be a consequence of counter culture. Part of me thinks that it’s other people waking up and realizing that deep down conservatism requires a bit of anger. That’s the thing that gets me, so many conservative people are just fucking angry. They call people names, they say they’re being attacked, yet generally nobody is attacking conservatives as a whole the way that Fox News is attacking liberals. 

Do left wing outlets like CNN and Vox have a left leaning bias? Yeah. But it seems like the pundits fact check a hell of a lot more than Fox pundits do, who really just rely on stirring the pot or flat out lying. 

The most interesting thing about liberals is all the infighting. It welcomes and accepts people who have different ideas and backgrounds, so it also sort of creates this chaos of free thinking. 

For example, it is generally the consensus that liberals are anti-gun. I am an avid gun owner, sport shooter, and collector (again, I live in a rural area). I reject the NRA, but am a member of the 2nd amendment foundation, and have a concealed carry permit/weapon. When I talk to my friends who are far more liberal than me, we have an honest discussion. They do disagree with me on certain things, but I explain that I deeply respect the weapons I own, and the responsibility that comes with them. I firmly believe in a mandatory license prior to being allowed to purchase a firearm. The requirements of said license would be a training course, background check, and insurance. Where I live only a background check is require to purchase a weapon. When you get to your concealed carry permit, then we get into the mandatory classes. When I explain these points, which are rooted in logic, not emotion or what other people told them, they understand my position, even if they still disagree. 

However, if I try to have a conversation about abortion with a conservative, holy shit, all hell breaks loose. Name calling, talking over me, and just overall disrespect. It’s nuts.

But I think the response to that commentary was so positive, the execs decided to make it an almost nightly segment, and it started to feel more like schtick and less like something legitimately special or important.

They’ve done the same thing with “breaking news” which also really pisses me off.

Oh yeah, and the same goes for the ticker.

eqsgskh,"John Oliver is a different type of performer. He deserves a lot of credit for bringing back the long form deep dive journalism on subjects. They aren't always huge subjects but they cover a wide range of different topics and dig deep into them, even things that he admits might cause your first instinct to be ""Lets change the channel"". Things like the deep dive on medical examiner issues wouldn't get covered in the Daily Show. Its important to do journalism on the small issues as well as whats happenint in DC because those are the things that are most likely affect you. I think that Hasan Minaj is good at doing a similar style program that touches on things you might not see covered much in America. The influence of Oliver is apparent but also its wholly unique. Since John Oliver has become so famous and popular you have seen a rise of traditional journalists doing similar style informative mini docs or long form journalism without the comedy. 

Also I think Trevor Noah gets a lot more shit than he deserves largely because he isn't Jon Stewart. I was guilty of the same thing when he came to the show in a way that was Stewart or bust but have since realized that he is incredible in his own way and has a unique take on American politics that is important. A lot of what he does is point out the absurdity where as Stewart was more emotional. 

In the end, I think all of these styles are valuable and highly entertaining as well as informative. You are missing out by not watching them.",politics,29,1560284563.0,comment
eqsabrt,"Also, with one being you know... the Daily Show

Jon was able to go into topics every single weekday. He really banged against the cage constantly. Oliver's show is once a week and has long gaps in seasons. Stewart did thousands of episodes... Oliver won't get anywhere close to a thousand.

There's also the fact, as close-minded as it may sound, that Jon is American. He lived in this country his entire life and grew up seeing American politics first-hand. Not saying that John Oliver's show isn't well-researched and sourced, but there is that slight disconnect there between American politics being touched on by Stewart and Oliver.",politics,99,1560280334.0,comment

eqt4j2p,"Okay, I was gonna be nice but now you’ve gone too far. So let me explain something, Deep Dish Pizza is not only not better than New York pizza, it’s not pizza. It’s a fucking casserole.

I’m surprised you haven’t thought to complete your Deep Dish Pizza by putting some canned onion rings on top of it. It’s a corn bread biscuit which you melted cheese on and then in defiance of God and man and all things holy, you’ve poured uncooked marinara sauce ‘atop’ the cheese. ‘Atop’, the cheese, on top the sauce; naked, cold, on display like some sort of sauce whore.
You know the expression “there’s no such thing as bad sex or bad pizza” your pizza is like sex with a corpse made of sandpaper. Let me tell you something!

This is not pizza, this is tomato soup in a bread bowl. This, is in an above ground marinara swimming pool for rats. Let me tell you something about your fucking not pizza, I wanna know, when I get drunk and pass out on my pizza that I’m not gonna drown.

Let me tell you something, I look at this. I look at this…mahron [moron]…you son of a bitch I look at this…me aahh…gaba goo..I-look at this. When I look at your deep dish fucking pizza, I dont know weather to eat it, or throw a coin in it and make a wish. And if I’d made a wish, it would be that I wish for some real fucking pizza.

Now, now in all due respect, I realize it’s very cold in Chicago, very cold it’s windy you need to be able to – I don’t know have a pizza and maybe cut it open and climb inside it like a tauntaun,
to keep you warm.
Seriously, who you – who you kidding? Who uses an iron skillet to make a pizza? You don’t use an iron skillet to make a pizza, you use an iron skillet to fend off someone who tries to serve you a fucking pizza made with a skillet.

Here’s how you know I’m right, you call it Chicago style pizza you call it Deep Dish Pizza, stuffed pizza, you know what we call it you know what we call this, know we call this? Pizza. Oh that’s nice and by the way you don’t put tomatoes and celery salt on fucking hot dogs either, you know what I’m saying?

eqsqhnc,"If we're talking about late night hosts and especially their relation to Stewart's skillset, we really need to talk about Samantha Bee. I was having this conversation with someone recently, none of the late night hosts (colbert, sadly; Noah, Meyers, etc.) are finding the right balance, struck by Stewart, between comedy and gravity. 

My argument is John Oliver and Samantha Bee are the only two coming close. John, for all the reasons stated above, and Sam for her incisive and angry delivery. She's making jokes a mile a minute, but is still finding that sweet spot in getting across the severity of what is happening in the world and the anger you know she feels. Bee is the one standing up for women and for that reason her show has been pigeonholed into having a mostly female audience. But that's a real shame because she is doing great work, diving deep into women's issues with the added little bonus of being a woman and experiencing the shit first hand. But she doesn't focus on women's issues only. She is hitting everyone on hypocrisy, regardless of the letter next to their name. She's making a lot of sense in a way democrats need to hear. I don't align with her politics to the letter, but she doesn't pull punches on anyone. Of course she hits the right hard, but her incision cuts both ways. She's a better replacement for stewart than colbert, but I gotta cut him some slack because his show has historically been far more lighthearted (late show on cbs,I mean).

That's not to take anything away from John Oliver because he is speaking out on women's issues well, but not quite as hard as Sam bee. And she really is arguably the funniest in late night, not to mention the only woman currently. Even when they pan over the audience and when you hear the audience cheering, it's mostly a female audience, but I say again she is saying shit men need to hear.",politics,26,1560291165.0,comment

The Clinton email scandal is in full swing, everyone has picked their corners. But two *very important details* are oft ignored:

* The first, slightly well known attribute of the scandal; most of the information on her servers was *retroactively classified,* which means she would not have had classified material on her servers at the time of sending and would not have been made aware of the retroactive action.

* The second, less understood; as Secretary of State, Clinton was the Original Classification Authority (OCA) for the State Department. An OCA has complete dominion over the level of classification for information under their purview. In the case of Clinton, she had control of all State Department-owned information, and how it was classified. So when she sent the emails, she had total authority to designate whether the information was even classified *at all.*

Ivanka, on the other hand, is not an OCA. She has no classification authorities. If *any* of that information is classified, she's fucked and will need to rely on a pardon. Donald (I patronizingly call him DJ) is an OCA, but can't retroactively declassify the information to keep her safe. Also, that's why DJ could tell us about Area 51 with no consequences, or why he got away with casually sharing classified info with Russians in the West Wing.

As an aside, Comey was the OCA for FBI, which is why DJ's assertions that Comey's notes should be classified and he should be prosecuted went nowhere fast.",politics,26,1542675603.0,comment

This is mind blowing.

It wasn't even like a pre-existing private email account that she inadvertently happened to use.

This was a private account set up specifically in their preparation of working the White House. They decided it with premeditation, that they would use private email for government business, literally right after a Presidential campaign where they spent the entire year shitting on their opponent for using private email for government business.

ea2j9rc,"It's interesting that she makes that claim. In September 2017, it was first reported that she was [using a personal email address](https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-trump-personal-email-account-white-house-670700) to communicate with a government official. The email mentioned in that report was sent on February 28, 2017. Ivanka became a federal employee in March 2017. In responding to the news report, a White House spokesperson said that 

>When she became a federal employee in March, “she made clear that one of her reasons for doing so was to ensure that she would have access to government-issued communications devices and receive an official email account to protect government records.

Ivanka and Jared also had a private email address on the [Kushner family domain](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/jared-kushner-email-account-white-house-243389) that they used to send emails about travel, scheduling, and official White House documents.

Jared also used his private email [for official business](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/jared-kushner-private-email-white-house-243071). This was separate from his Kushner family account. The news about his and Ivanka's private email addresses broke on September 25, 2017. Eight days later, it was reported that their personal email accounts were [re-routed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/03/exclusive-jared-kushners-personal-email-moved-trump-organization-computers-amid-public-scrutiny/728467001/) to computers run by the Trump Organization.

[At least 4 other White House aides](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/private-email-trump-kushner-bannon.html) used their personal email accounts for government business. This includes Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn, and Stephen Miller. The problem was widespread enough that, in July 2017, Priebus told aides to [store their phones in secure lockers](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/25/trump-white-house-email-personal-243129) or leave them at home. His request was largely ignored, and aides continued to use their personal devices for calls, emails, and texts regarding White House matters.",politics,1224,1542674451.0,comment

You'll have better luck contacting your reps in congress about it. You can find them and their contact information at this website. https://www.congress.gov/members

You can find your senate members here. https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/

Also, don't forget this isn't entirely up to Pai. It takes a 3 vote majority of the 5 member committee to go through. 

You can find those 5 members here. https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership

A quick breakdown: 

Pai of course. His vote will be to approve the repeal. 

Mignon Clyburn. One of the people who first voted to approve net neutrality. 

Michael O'Rielly. One of the people who first voted against net neutrality when it was passed. He's the key. It's him we need to approach. His contact information is on the website. I urge you all to email, fax, and call his offices. 


Brendan Carr. Hand picked by Trump to back up Pai in repealing net neutrality. He's also worked for ISPs in the past. Smaller chance of him vote against the repeal, but it wouldn't hurt to contact him as well. 

Jessica Rosenworcel, another democrat, and the other person of currently on the council who voted for net neutrality.

And now, instead of recognizing the real problem here, everyone is eager to blame this one unelected guy, instead of the president, congress, and senate who appointed and empowered him to enact their agenda. 

The only reason we even know this guy's name is because the non-voters and republican voters here on reddit can't defend their decision to allow an all-republican government and so destroy net neutrality. So we get this false narrative that the problem is just this rogue guy.

dqdvihg,"I hear what you’re saying here. It’s a very fair point. I’m not even saying you’re wrong. But just like this seems to be a pet peeve of yours, your comment triggered a pet peeve of my own.

Between this and Battlefront and most things anti-Trump related on Reddit, I see so many comments along the lines of ‘you’re fooling yourself if you think you’re doing any good here’. In a sense, these comments are 100% correct. There could be a bajillion signatures and Pai wouldn’t lose a second of sleep. EA will likely give lip service and a consolation prize just large enough to make people forget for a while.

But perfect is the enemy of good, and all things have to start somewhere. Discouraging people from the outset stomps the kindling before it has a chance to spark. It’s like belittling people from the Phillipines from protesting against Duerte: “do you really think Duerte is going to care if a hundred peasants go to the streets?”. Hell no. But if he ignores them and people see it’s acceptable to voice their opinions, more people will do so. If he cracks down, then a hundred angry protestors suddenly turns into 100 FAMILIES personally impacted by his actions. That is how dissent grows. Fatalism kills it in its tracks, and results in the norm remaining the norm.

If Trump weren’t POTUS, I doubt they’d have any reservations whatsoever about making absolutely certain he wasn’t working on behalf of Russia.

edvhjra,"► Trump was first compromised by the Russians back in the 80s in the days of the Soviet Union. [In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it continued for decades](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.

► In 1984, David Bogatin — a Russian mobster, convicted gasoline bootlegger, and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))

► Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.

► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. (Mogilevich's role today is unclear).

► One of the most important things that is often overlooked is that the Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.

► From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""

►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). 

► According to a Bloomberg investigation ([March 16, 2017](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs)) into Trump World Tower, which broke ground in 1998, “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”

► Here is the most prominent example: In July 2008, the height of the recession, Donald Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value. 

► As an example of the Russian mob operating out of Trump Tower, in 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. In addition to card games, they operated illegal gambling websites, ran a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich. 

► It has been widely known for decades that Russia often used videotaped ""honey traps"" to compromise influential visitors. General Oleg Kalugin, former head of counterintelligence for the KGB, told Craig Unger (Author, ""House of Trump, House of Putin"") they probably did this with Trump during his visit to Russia in 1987--long before the events in the Steele dossier. ""I can't tell what is inside Trump's mind, but everyone who traveled to Russia knew this.""

►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor. And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.

► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M [from Russia](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/148961/evidence-emerges-nras-russia-connection), then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. The big white shoe law firms--Jones Day, for example-- represent powerful Russian oligarchs who have billions and billions of dollars. Much of this is legal even though it appears to have compromised huge parts of the GOP. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. 

► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets."" 

► Eric Trump told James Dodson, a golf reporter, in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because “We don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.”

► Trump's first wife, Ivana, was under surveillance by the STB, the Czech secret police, and they reported to the KGB. Ivana got out of Communist Czechoslovakia in the 70s which was not easy to do.

► Regarding the Steele dossier, while not everything in the dossier has been corroborated, some of it has and none of it has been disproven. Christopher Steele has a terrific reputation in the intelligence world. For reference, Jeb Bush's opposition research included paying a US based intelligence firm (GPS Fusion), who reached out to Steele. This same intelligence firm was later hired by Clinton during her campaign. All of this was above-board and verifiable. 

► At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a [strong push](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/04/defying-history-moscow-moves-defend-soviet-war-afghanistan/?utm_term=.d077fc6cf274) for a resolution that would justify their country’s 1979 invasion and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists’ goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on [January 2nd](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-cracked-afghan-history-11546560234), Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.

► We don't know who may be prosecuted with Deutsche Bank, but Russian money laundering is a huge part of this and how they compromised Trump. Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/). They own him.

>One solution was to make wider use of “the facilities of friendly intelligence services”—for example, Czechoslovakian or East German spy networks.
And: “Further improvement in operational work with agents calls for fuller and wider utilisation of confidential and special unofficial contacts. These should be acquired chiefly among prominent figures in politics and society, and important representatives of business and science.” These should not only “supply valuable information” but also “actively influence” a country’s foreign policy “in a direction of advantage to the USSR.”

&nbsp;

>The KGB also distributed a secret personality questionnaire, advising case officers what to look for in a successful recruitment operation. In April 1985 this was updated for “prominent figures in the West.” 

&nbsp;

>There were other questions, too: what was the likelihood that the “subject could come to power (occupy the post of president or prime minister)”? And an assessment of personality. For example: “Are pride, arrogance, egoism, ambition or vanity among subject’s natural characteristics?”

&nbsp;

>Finally, “his attitude towards women is also of interest.” The document wanted to know: “Is he in the habit of having affairs with women on the side?”

&nbsp;

>When did the KGB open a file on Donald Trump? We don’t know, but Eastern Bloc security service records suggest this may have been as early as 1977. That was the year when Trump married Ivana Zelnickova, a twenty-eight-year-old model from Czechoslovakia. Zelnickova was a citizen of a communist country. She was therefore of interest both to the Czech intelligence service, the StB, and to the FBI and CIA.

&nbsp;

>According to files in Prague, declassified in 2016, Czech spies kept a close eye on the couple in Manhattan. (The agents who undertook this task were code-named Al Jarza and Lubos.) They opened letters sent home by Ivana to her father, Milos, an engineer. Milos was never an agent or asset. But he had a functional relationship with the Czech secret police, who would ask him how his daughter was doing abroad and in return permit her visits home. There was periodic surveillance of the Trump family in the United States. And when Ivana and Donald Trump, Jr., visited Milos in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, further spying, or “cover.” ",politics,98,1547258801.0,comment

eduwrue,">The investigation the F.B.I. opened into Mr. Trump also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether his firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice.

>Agents and senior F.B.I. officials had grown suspicious of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off on opening an investigation into him, the people said, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude. But the president’s activities before and after Mr. Comey’s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the people said.

>The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the inquiry into Mr. Trump when he was appointed, days after F.B.I. officials opened it. 

-

>The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.

>If the president had fired Mr. Comey to stop the Russia investigation, the action would have been a national security issue because it naturally would have hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved, according to James A. Baker, who served as F.B.I. general counsel until late 2017. 

-

>“Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times.

-

>The F.B.I. conducts two types of inquiries, criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests.

>Mr. Trump had caught the attention of F.B.I. counterintelligence agents when he called on Russia during a campaign news conference in July 2016 to hack into the emails of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump had refused to criticize Russia on the campaign trail, praising President Vladimir V. Putin. And investigators had watched with alarm as the Republican Party softened its convention platform on the Ukraine crisis in a way that seemed to benefit Russia.

-

>But law enforcement officials put off the decision to open the investigation until they had learned more, according to people familiar with their thinking. As for a counterintelligence inquiry, they concluded that they would need strong evidence to take the sensitive step of investigating the president, and they were also concerned that the existence of such an inquiry could be leaked to the news media, undermining the entire investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election.

>After Mr. Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, two more of Mr. Trump’s actions prompted them to quickly abandon those reservations.

>The first was a letter Mr. Trump wanted to send to Mr. Comey about his firing, but never did, in which he mentioned the Russia investigation. In the letter, Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Comey for previously telling him he was not a subject of the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation.

>Even after the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, wrote a more restrained draft of the letter and told Mr. Trump that he did not have to mention the Russia investigation — Mr. Comey’s poor handling of the Clinton email investigation would suffice as a fireable offense, he explained — Mr. Trump directed Mr. Rosenstein to mention the Russia investigation anyway.

>He disregarded the president’s order, irritating Mr. Trump. The president ultimately added a reference to the Russia investigation to the note he had delivered, thanking Mr. Comey for telling him three times that he was not under investigation.

>The second event that troubled investigators was an NBC News interview two days after Mr. Comey’s firing in which Mr. Trump appeared to say he had dismissed Mr. Comey because of the Russia inquiry.",politics,122,1547256974.0,comment

Another wonderment is whether or not the recent “let them eat cake” moment from the White House economist is supposed to piss people off.

I have no end of questions and conspiracies regarding this, because it looks like a god damned Manchurian Candidate conspiracy.

Edit: more than one person asked about “let them eat cake moment. It was this quote from the White House economic adviser:

“A huge share of government workers were going to take vacation days, say, between Christmas and New Year’s. And then we have a shutdown, and so they can’t go to work, and so then they have the vacation, but they don’t have to use their vacation days. And then they come back, and then they get their back pay. Then they’re — in some sense, they’re better off.”

https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/11/white-house-economic-adviser-shutdown-vacation-for-workers-1098380

You know, because we all have vacation days to burn at now pay and worrying about when the government will re-open. As Pelosi said, we can’t all borrow from our fathers when we miss a paycheck.

Trump’s quotes on this issue are also outrageous, encouraging those who rent to those affected by his shutdown to go “nice and easy” on affected tenants, as well as saying he has support from those he is fucking right now.

When asked if his personal wealth is mostly bank loans by a journalist in the 90s, Trump got very upset and said even if they were loans, it's still in his account so it's his money. Eventually, by the 2000s, American banks had figured out what he was up to and stopped loaning to him. They couldn't arrest him or sue him, though, because he owed them so much money that it was in their interest to keep him free if they ever wanted to see that money again.

Either HSBC, the preferred bank of organized crime organizations around the world, stepped up to loan him the money and then passed it on to Russian oligarchs or they helped him get in contact with some oligarchs who could help him with his money issues if he would help them in return.

100% Trump is working actively to sabotage the US economy and geopolitical interests. This shutdown is a way of doing that while obstructing investigations into him and buying more time for his handlers to engineer him a golden parachute or his lawyers to find some hail mary to save him.

They will be sued.  This may violate the Administrative Procedure Act.  First, there is an argument to be made that it violates section 553 (c) which requires a concise general statement as to why they ignored the vast majority of comments against the rule (which assumes many things leading up to that point).  Second, one can argue it violates section 706 (2)(a) which holds unlawful and sets aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Third, there are constitutional issues with this proposed rule.

In my opinion, the internet is free speech protected under the 1st amendment, thus, corporations shall not abridge free speech by profiting from the removal of net neutrality. 

As always, there will be many arguments against my point. One comment below pointed many of them out. We cannot rely on yelling into the echochambers of the internet we are trying to protect. We must engage reality and peacefully force change. We must vote for those who encourage the guiding hands of compassion, science, and reason to aid in our legislative processes.

Don't forget that governments at many levels paid broadband providers enormous sums of money to build out their networks, which they happily pocketed, after which they did nothing.

For example, in my home state of Pennsylvania, the state [gave Verizon over $2 billion in tax breaks](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/verizon-pennsylvanias-com_b_7532008.html) to run fiber to homes statewide. By employing some clever language tricks, they claim they've met the contract requirements in the form of their cellular network (that they'd've built anyway) and as a result, significant portions of the rural parts of the state still have DSL at best, and dialup at worst.

The destroying of net neutrality in the United States will have a profound effect the world over. It will result in a more limited access to information, a higher barrier to entry into the marketplace and will cut deep into the economy.

With everything going on in the United States of America today, I think it's time that those of you who still have your wits about you to do what you have done time and time again over the past few centuries and let out a loud collective ""Fuck this shit"". 

Whatever that means is up to you, but what I can tell you it does mean is getting up off your computer and assembling. What you choose to do when you assemble is pretty irrelevant, but it will require a very loud message to be sent. If that means 2 million people walking into congress and the FCC headquarters so be it. Whatever it means it has to send the message that the American people will not tolerate this anymore.

dq5p9yc,"One of the reasons was because a large number of the comments were sent by bots.  

The telcos themselves paid for a [study](http://www.emprata.com/emp2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/FCC-Restoring-Internet-Freedom-Comments-Analysis.pdf) finding that, of uniquely written comments, 1.77 million were FOR Title II Net neutrality, whereas only 24 thousand were AGAINST Title II Net Neutrality.  This is out of nearly 22 million total comments.  One form letter against NN was submitted 7.8 million times, using fake/generated email addresses.  

All these fake comments from bots allowed the FCC to de-legitimize the entire public comment process.  It is weaponized disinformation.  There are advantages to the default of pseudo-anonymity on the Internet, but this is one costs.

It's sad that this has become such a political issue, but that's just the reality of the situation.  The Republican party (and Koch-funded libertarian policy institutes) have systematically undermined antitrust enforcement for decades.  They complain about ""regulatory capture,"" the corrupt relationship between industry and government agencies, but this is projection.  THEY are the worst offenders.  Want an example?  Look no further than [Republican former commissioner Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Attwell_Baker).  After the FCC approved the merger of NBC/Universal and Comcast, she resigned from the commission and became the vice president for government affairs at the combined entity.  This is how the industry quasi-legally hands out huge piles of cash to reward its corrupt servants.  This is precisely the kind of swamp-monster behavior that needs to be burned out of Washington, and it's exactly the opposite of what the party of projection and their hypocrite-in-chief have been up to.

There's a small chance that this will be stopped by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but... in reality?  The only way you're going to stop this long-term is to elect Democrats.

This is a hugely unpopular thing that has seen millions speak out, but the problem is that if we kill this vote today, it will be back tomorrow, or the next month or the next year. It will come back at some point because this isn't legislation. 

The general public hasn't understood the real risks here, and they aren't going to yet but all of us know that Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, they are all going to move quickly to take advantage of this vote, and it's going to suck. 

What we need isn't an FCC ruling, or guidelines that can shift on the whim of one man with an overly large cup, what we need is actual legislation. Something that would require a senate vote and a presidential signature to change. We aren't likely to get that from this congress of course, but no matter how you feel about Democrats, coming in to a year they expect to make gains in, a freebie softball policy position that they can gain traction on Republicans is meat no politician can pass up.

Ajit Pai, FCC Chairman: 1-202-418-1000  
  
Reddit won't let me post the rest of the FCC contact information, something with the formatting and the automod, I think.  You can click [here, to go to the FCC's official contact page.](https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact)

You need to contact your representatives and senators about **Net Neutrality** even if they already support it, but *especially* if they don't.   
  
Remember that this very thread is only possible because of a free and open internet; kill net neutrality and threads like this might be a thing of the past.

Easy way #1:
  
Step 1: Go to [BattleForTheNet.com.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)  
Step 2: Do what [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) tells you to do.  
  
---  
  
Easy way #2:  
  
Text RESIST to 50409, and they'll walk you through the process.  (I've been told.  I've never done it myself.  Fees and whatnot may apply.)  

---
 
The harder, but still very easy way:

Step 1:  Find out who your Representative and Senator is/are.  
  
 * [Find your Representative.](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)  
 * [Find your Senator.](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/)  
 * [Local elected officials.](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials)  


Step 2: Find your Representative and Senator's contact information.  

 * [5calls.org has a decent repository of Representatives and Senators contact information, though the site is a bit difficult to navigate.](https://5calls.org/)  
 * [Call My Congress just asks for your zip code and tells you what district you live in, who your Representatives are, and how to contact them.](https://www.callmycongress.com/)
 * [DailyKos has a list of *all* of our Senator's phone numbers, not just the DC office.](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/2/1629046/-Call-your-senator-Phone-numbers-for-every-office-of-every-U-S-senator)  (Current as of February, 2017.)  
 * FaxZero has a system set up allowing you to fax your [Representatives](https://faxzero.com/fax_congress.php) and [Senators](https://faxzero.com/fax_senate.php) for free!  (Faxes are good if you can't get through on the phone lines, or just if you want congressional staffers to listen to fax machine noises until Net Neutrality is safe.)  
 
  * [Fax Congress](https://faxzero.com/fax_congress.php)  
  * [Fax Senators](https://faxzero.com/fax_senate.php)  
  
Step 3: Call, write, or fax to express your feelings on this.  
  
A lot of people are nervous about calling their elected officials for the first time, maybe you don't know what to say, or how to say it, or even who you'll be talking to, so here's what you'll need to know.  
  
1. There's a 75% chance your call will be answered by a Secretary who is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there's a 25% chance your call will be bumped into a voicemail box which is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there is a ~0% chance you'll find yourself on the phone with your Senator or Representative.  
  
2.  You may be asked for your name and address or zip code, it's okay not to tell them if you don't want to, but the information *is* useful for your elected officials.  I usually just give my first name, zip code, and the name of my town.  
  
3.  Don't worry about a script, don't worry about being eloquent, you're not writing Shakespeare here, you're a concerned citizen voicing their frustrations, fears, and hopes.  ""I'm really scared of Ajit Pai's plans to roll back net neutrality, a free and open internet is important to me because [Your reason here.  Some suggestions: An open internet is important to democracy/I worry what Donald Trump might do with more power/Cable bills are already too high/etc.].  Please tell [Senator or Representative] that I support a free and open internet, I support Net Neutrality, ***and I vote.***""  The only hard and fast rule is that you need to be polite; these folks are getting dozens, if not hundreds of calls a day, they don't need you bitching and swearing at them for something they have no control over.  Be passionate, but be polite.  
  
Reminder: ***Only call YOUR OWN elected officials!***  Calling Mitch McConnell from sunny Florida won't do anyone any good, and might actually harm the cause.  Only call your own elected officials, period.

dq60f0k,"> This may violate the Administrative Procedure Act. First, there is an argument to be made that it violates section 553 (c) which requires a concise general statement as to why they ignored the vast majority of comments against the rule

An argument can be made that *what* violates 553? The final rule hasn’t been adopted yet, and the speculation that they might fail to address the substance of those comments is... well, pure speculation.

But it’s important to be clear on what the APA requires.

>requires a concise general statement as to why they ignored the vast majority of comments against the rule

No, it doesn’t. The agency has no obligation to address what constituted the “vast majority” of comments, only to address the substantive arguments and evidence raised by those comments. An agency *may* consider predominant public opinion, but is not bound by it nor bound by explaining why they didn’t follow “the vast majority of comments.”

>one can argue it violates section 706 (2)(a) which holds unlawful and sets aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

One can, but is unlikely to be successful. Absent a statutory requirement that “how many people support the rule versus opposing it” be a factor to be considered (NB: such a statutory requirement does not exist here), the number of comments is irrelevant. Which means we’re in traditional informal rulemaking analysis. 

And as the Court has repeatedly explained, the courts are not meant to override an agency on a matter of policy based solely on disagreeing with the agency’s view of the right policy. *See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.*, 463 U.S. 29 (1983)

Or, to put it more simply:

An agency is not required to prove that it made a good decision, only that its “explanation [demonstrate] that it examined the data, considered the relevant factors, and made a reasonable judgment based on the record.” *MD Pharm., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin.*, 133 F.3d 8, 16 (D.C. Cir. 1998).",politics,5,1511309166.0,comment

I'd like to see him back that up with *any* non-ISP involved source.

The local internet in my area switched from 10mb for $100 a month to 50mb for $100 a month (100mb is $200!) overnight because of Title 2. After the local ISP said for a decade that they couldn't do it, and gave every excuse in the book. No competition for 30 years because of some bullshit agreement with the county or some bull allowed them to fuck over every consumer in the area. And seeing as it was the only internet besides Satellite, people didn't have a choice.

>""As I said previously, the raw number is not as important as the substantive comments that are in the record,"" Pai said at a press conference following yesterday's monthly FCC meeting.

>Pai was answering a question posed by reporter Lynn Stanton of TRDaily. Stanton asked, ""shouldn't the number of consumers who feel they are detrimentally affected be a factor in a cost-benefit analysis of what you do?"" Pai did not give a definitive yes-or-no answer to the question of whether the number of pro-net neutrality comments would make any difference in his decision.

>Pai previously addressed specific comments on one occasion, when he praised the ""exceptionally important contribution to the debate"" made by a group of 19 nonprofit municipal-broadband providers who oppose the current net neutrality rules.

> (c) After notice required by this section, ***the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments ***with or without opportunity for oral presentation. After ***consideration of the relevant matter presented, the agency shall incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose. ***When rules are required by statute to be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing, sections 556 and 557 of this title apply instead of this subsection

So ignoring the results wouldn’t seem to meet this criteria. 

And ignoring the documented false submissions would also seem to show any rule making is based on false data. 

Anybody with any experience of this know if that’s the case and any case law/precedence? 

Edit: This may be a better breakdown of examples for when this can be used but I’m still confused as to whether the way the public comment period was handled is problematic for their moving forward with the rulemaking process

dq60249,"having studied a lot of revolutions it takes generally one of a few things.

1. No food or Money - this is the fastest way. France's revolution was more about food at first then about ""freedom, brotherhood and equality"" 

2. Death - The killing of an important figure can set off the long held frustrations of a people. See the failed Paris Uprising of 1832 made famous in Les Miserable. 

But more often it is a slow burn that boils over seemingly at random, where long and stable governments fall in days or weeks. See Romania in 1989. 

Dec 17th - Small protests, led to bigger student anti-gov protests. 

Dec 21st - Dictator gives speech to ""pro-communist"" crowd, gets booed and heckled on live TV, looks nervous. Protests grow but are stopped by the military.

Dec 22nd - mass protests around the whole country. People break into gov buildings, flees by helicopter.

Dec 25th - tried and executed by provisional gov.

While this is a short example I doubt that on Dec 1st he would have thought that he would be dead by the 25th. 

TLDR: Revolutions usually happen after a long time of anger and feelings of being unheard. Then something happens and the long simmer turns into a boil that sometimes boils over into a full revolution, but can often be suppressed by military might. See Hungry 1956.",politics,6,1511308731.0,comment

It’ll depend on how the rule and explanation is actually drafted, but Pai correctly stated (in the interview being referenced above) that an administrative agency must respond to the substance of the comments.

dq5y6n0,"It’s important to start off by distinguishing a few things. First, what Pai said was that “the raw number is not as important as the substantive comments that are in the record”, and that is true.

The administrative procedures act requires that the agency respond to the comments, not that it give any particular credence to them. If the final rule addresses the substantive arguments of a million pre-written comments submitted from “gofccyourself.net”, those million comments have been sufficiently addressed.

Nor does the agency have to provide specific response to conclusory comments of the “I want net neutrality to stay, don’t get rid of it” variety.

>And ignoring the documented false submissions would also seem to show any rule making is based on false data.

Probably not, unless there is some information contained in those submissions that does not appear in any other source in the agency’s record.

This whole fight over the number of comments on either side has never been relevant, the agency is not bound by the numbers. The fact that there were submissions claiming to be from individuals who didn’t actually submit them doesn’t really matter unless the agency were required to give weight based on volume of comments, which they aren’t.

Think of it this way: the fact that there are five million comments saying “it will be bad for new internet startups who may not be able to buy priority bandwidth” is not required (under the APA) to mean more than if there were five of them. 

The fact that there were 200 comments saying that this would be good for consumers as it allows for those who don’t use as much bandwidth to stop subsidizing more consuming users doesn’t matter more than if there were 2.

So even if half of all anti-net neutrality comments were “false submissions”, it wouldn’t matter. The half that are properly there are still on the record and can still form some basis of the rule. The only way it would matter is if the agency gave those arguments more weight because of the number of unique submissions, which they are unlikely to.

>Anybody with any experience of this know if that’s the case and any case law/precedence?

For which part?

I’m not being glib, it’s just a really big subject and I don’t want to waste your time citing cases for the proposition that the volume of comments supporting a particular view is irrelevant if what you really care about is what is considered sufficient to have addressed the comments’ substance.

And a big part of this is going to depend on how the final rule is actually phrased. If it’s argued as a matter of statutory interpretation (i.e the FCC saying “we cannot regulate broadband as common carriers because they fall under information services rather than telecommunications, but we can require greater transparency as a matter of policy”) the agency arguably gets *Chevron* deference and agencies rarely lose with *Chevron* deference. 

Though then you get into some interesting cases about whether a prior agency statutory interpretation was viewed as the *only* interpretation, or just a *valid* interpretation.

If it’s a pure policy issue? There we get into sufficiency of response, and the cases where the courts have held that an agency failed to consider comments are predominately cases where the agency actually failed to respond to them in their rulemaking.

> I’m still confused as to whether the way the public comment period was handled is problematic for their moving forward with the rulemaking process

Well... the easier way to do this might be to ask what you think was problematic.

They issued notice, received comments, and we’re awaiting the final rulemaking which will be required to consider (i.e respond to) the substantive arguments raised in the comments. 

If your question is whether what Pai said somehow makes the rulemaking less valid... not really, he accurately stated that an agency is not bound by considerations of sheer volume of comments.",politics,23,1511306542.0,comment

This is worse than book burning. Your internet will be about as informative as TLC and The History Channel when this shit comes to pass.

And where X + tiny amount of latency will cause a browser to assume the page is not available. Thus blocking content they claim simply isn't in the ""hyperspeed lane"" that they talked about years ago when this shit started. The same kind of delays will break certain features on websites now that the internet is not just a series of .HTML files and images but living pages actively communicating with a database.

We don’t live in any form of democracy other than name. DINO, Democracy in Name Only. The only difference is that our oligarchs stopped trying to pretend that our voice matters. The GO in GOP is for “GO fuck yourself” 

There isn’t any secret conspiracy to destroy America, these people just don’t care about anything outside their wealth bubble. So long as they can make a dollar off it, that’s what they do. If Trump could sell California to the highest bidder he would. If it means putting a Pedophile in office, they will. We keep seeing “party over country” it’s not, it’s profits above all else. 

The GOP has a perfect opportunity to throw trump under the bus, along with Moore and others claiming that they have been compromised. Fox would push the message of how their “moral high ground” saved the country while the democrats sat idly back and let the country go to shit, and their dumb shit  viewers would believe it. They would be able to ram all their shit legislation through even faster, while boosting their image and avoiding all the forthcoming scandals. Yet they don’t. Because they don’t give a shit even for their own party, wealth is simply the only goal, no matter what or who it fucks over and destroys. The faster the better.

Well, the most popular viewpoint can also be of substance, but the agency is not required to give any extra weight to “five thousand people submitted this form letter” than to analyze the argument and evidence itself.

Agencies are not meant to be responsive directly to public opinion. They are meant to analyze the evidence and form an expert decision on the best policy.

dq694oo,"I think they are on board with fascism's general tenants. Look at this list and see if it looks familiar. They are calling themselves ""Neo-Reactionaries"" now. 

Umberto Eco, 14 points:


 * The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”
 
* The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”
   
* The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”
 
*  Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”
 
* Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”
  
 *  Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”
   
*  The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”
   
*  The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”
   
 * Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”
    
* Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”
   
* Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.” (This is what is different from standard fascism: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism)

*  Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”
  
 *  Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”
    
*  Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

The Senate in December passed a 93-7 Bipartisan bill to fund the government without border wall funding, which was passed by Mitch McConnell and passed by the House (?), but rejected by the White House. The House then passed their own bill, with border wall funding which was rejected by the Senate and killed.

Then the shutdown happened, and Democrats took over.

Now, Mitch McConnell has the power to override a Presidential Veto (aka if the first bipartisan bill reached his desk and he veto'd it, McConnell could override that because it has enough support in the Senate), but McConnell is refusing to do so for reasons. So, since McConnell is hiding behind Trump and his wishes, and Trump's wishes are ""$5.7 billion for a wall or nothing"", and McConnell is also rejecting ANY bill that comes forth in the Senate without border wall funding, that's why we're here.

Is that accurate? I mean basically you have one baby in the White House who wants ""all or nothing"", and another baby in the Senate who is straight up refusing to even hold votes on legislation to open the government because the President won't sign them.

I think it would fall under the House/Senate Committee on Appropriations (correct me if I'm wrong).

January 19th is the day the sanctions are lifted without a formal rebuke of the decision.

ee5gxg6,"This is an interesting take, and possibly an element, but I don't think it's *the* motivator.

Reasons (both very clear and some speculation) for this bullshit:

1. The wall is Trump's ego project, and not delivering makes him look like a dipshit in the eyes of his followers (especially since his most racist cheerleader talking heads immediately turn on him and make noise when he backs down from it, rather than letting him spin and get away with it).

2. It's just another con-job to steal taxpayer money and hand it off to his contractor/construction buddies who will get paid fat stacks of cash to make a useless wall that will have no impact on the problem it states it will address.

3. [""We Do Not Want Most Employees To Return""](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/senior-trump-official-anonymous-daily-caller-op-ed-shutdown-federal-workers). This is starve the beast in overdrive. The GOP is waiting out federal employees until they start to quit/leave for other work to survive so they can further crush and dismantle the government without having to do it legislatively. They are actively staging a fucking coup to privatize everything they can and dismantle everything else they can in order to crush the government's capacity for regulation and to profit off of all the services it use to provide.

4. Republicans are stuck. If they oppose Trump, they piss off the loyal cultists he still has. But by sticking to him, they piss off everyone else. They'e fucked no matter what and too scared to move in any direction because they're too cowardly to rip the bandaid off a problem they created and have to own.  I also personally believe the party itself is complicit in Trump's illegal activities with Russia and are shielding him to shield themselves.

5. What you just said is an interesting addition, though considering Schumer can force a vote on the sanctions I do wonder if it's just a happy accident or intentional. I wouldn't down for a second it being intentional, but would it be worth the effort when there was a way to bypass the move? Trump certainly isn't smart, so who knows.

6. A theory I had, but which is increasingly feeling less and less likely: that the shutdown is being allowed to bleed off support for Trump so he's easier to impeach/remove from office when the time comes. He's caused immense damage to the economy and is more trouble than he's worth, and it considering the Democrats have held on this shutdown (something they usually cave on), my assumption was their donors were telling them it was okay; let it happen, carve into his numbers, and lets be rid of him as we've used him as much as we can to get tax cuts and gut regulatory bodies. But, considering a lot of the other elements coming out about this shutdown, I'm beginning to greatly question if that speculation holds much water anymore. Edit: But, just to add/be clear, whether it's a reason or not Trump's numbers *are* going down over this.",politics,56,1547589884.0,comment

Fox suddenly convinced Trump to go with the shutdown despite a bipartisan deal.

The longer the shutdown goes on, the more angry EVERYONE is going to get, red and blue alike. Air Traffic will eventually shut down. Food stamps will stop coming. A REAL national emergency is coming and it will be one of artifice.

It's nowhere near as underhanded as Republicans are now so there's no doubt in my mind they would milk a rule like that to ruin another term as a minority like they did as the majority to Obama's last term.

Mitch McConnel is, in the humblest of my opinions, more to blame for the ongoing shut-down than even Trump as he refused to allow bills passed overwhelmingly by the house, which are nearly carbon copies of a bill that he himself passed just before the shutdown, to even have time for debate on the floor of the senate. He is denying the entire legislative branch the ability to do their jobs while claiming that giving bills to reopen the government time on the senate floor would be a waste of time because they wont get signed by the president, even though he knows full well that congress has the ability to override a presidential veto. McConnell is single handedly sabotaging the legislative branch and his fellow republicans in Senate are doing nothing about this besides giving platitudes on interviews about how much of a shame this is...

&#x200B;

It is a fucking shame and a fucking travesty, but if you're not going to call for a vote of no-confidence to remove McConnell from his position and replace him with someone who actually respects the will and voice of the House of Representatives and the millions of Americans that they represent, than they are equally complicit just don't have the balls or ovaries to do anything about lie about their frustration.

>  SEC. 112. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER AUTHORITY.  
(a) CASE-BY-CASE WAIVER AUTHORITY.—  
(1) IN GENERAL.—The President may waive, on a caseby-case basis and for a period of not more than 180 days,
a requirement under section 104, 105, 106, 107, or 108 to
impose or maintain sanctions with respect to a person, and
may waive the continued imposition of such sanctions, **not
less than 30 days after the President determines and reports
to the appropriate congressional committees** that it is vital
to the national security interests of the United States to waive
such sanctions. 

Emphasis mine.  The administration announced the lifting of the sanctions on Dec 19, 2018, *3 days before the shutdown began.*  The ""appropriate congressional committees"" I highlighted in the quoted part of the bill are the ones who are supposed to rebuke the decision, which is why the president is supposed to inform them 30 days prior to lifting them.

It's like McConnell is cooking a grenade; if his timing is even slightly off, it'll blow up his own god damn arm.

Total traffic from social media: 4.87%

Facebook 56.16%

Reddit: 14.86%

Twitter: 13.56%

quora: 7.07%

ee5l148,"For a more contemporary and mainstream example: it’s also a major plot point in *Thor: Ragnarok*.

Odin has a daughter, his first-born and Thor’s elder sister. She is violent, ruthless, and full of ambition. Together they conquer the nine realms. The Odin casts her out, banishes her into an extra-planar prison, and garners love and respect through benevolence and ridding the realms of this hated tyrannical figure (he put up to it and taught to be that way in the first place). 

Of course the movie introduces all this after she’s made her return, because Odin in his genuine shame had it all erased from history and hidden even from Thor and Loki, and it sets up the climax of the film. ",politics,9,1547592876.0,comment

> McConnell's plan is what I call the ""Harkonnen Gambit"".

>For context, in the science fiction novel Dune, the evil Baron Harkonnen installs his despotic, universally reviled nephew Rabban as the ruler of the planet Arrakis. His plan is to let things get so bad that the people of Arrakis rise up, at which point the baron will sacrifice Rabban and replace him with his favorite nephew, Feyd-Rautha, positioning the new ruler as the one who saved Arrakis from tyrrany, thus ensuring that Arrakis will love its new Harkonnen despot.

>In McConnell's case, he's capitalizing on the fact that Trump claimed responsibility for the shutdown (on camera!) like the fucking moron he is. Now all McConnell has to do is wait for things to get super bad, to the point where Trump's approval starts to tank even among Republicans. At that point he can pass whatever bill Congress can agree on, override Trump's inevitable veto, and effectively cut Trump off at the knees. Then Pence can move forward with 25'ing Trump, and McConnell and Pence will be hailed as saviors by right wing media.",politics,61,1547580385.0,comment
ee54s57,"Ok, first, read Dune. It's soooo damned good. 

There's the planet Arrakis which has the spice, most precious resource in the galaxy and the only thing that makes interstellar trade possible. The galaxy in Dune is basically feudal planets, with Dukes and Barons and a singular emperor. Before the start of Dune, one feudal family, the Harkonnens, have controlled Arrakis and all the commerce and wealth that comes from controlling the single resource that the entire galactic economy relies on. Harkonnens are shitty, and population of Arrakis hated them and were repressed by them and treated as peons. This caused disruptions to the spice economy and ""the spice must flow"" because galactic trade ceases without it, so the emperor gives lordship over the planet to a rival feudal house, the Atreides. Secretly the emperor wants the Atreides gone because they are more popular than him which is dangerous, so this appointment is just a ruse to get rid of them for the sake of the galactic economy. The citizens of Arrakis love the new feudal Lords, as they are respectful and generous. The Harkonnens and Emperor move against Atreides house, overthrow them, and banish survivors to desert. Then the Harkonnen Gambit takes place. Baron Harkonnen installs his shitty nephew nicknamed Beast Rabban to oppress and be awful to the planet to make up for the lost profits from the whole Atreides ordeal. Rabban is awful and does such, the Atreides survivors start a rebellion with the desert tribes to take back the planet, and in an effort to stamp out said rebellion Rabban starts murdering children and civilians. After it gets to a boiling point, the Baron will replace Rabban with his beloved jesus-esque nephew Feyd who can then execute Rabban for being oppressive. This would then play out so that the citizens now love the Harkonnens even though it's the same feudal house and same feudal policies that have oppressed the planet for a long damned time.

This means that if Pence was to become President for the remaining term after January 20th, he would be still be able to serve two terms as president. It would be possible for him to serve as president for nearly 10 years. 

>	McConnell and Pence will be hailed as saviors by right wing media

Pence being hailed as a savior makes him an even stronger 2020 candidate if he was to run. There’s also the possibility that Pence would pardon Trump, raising his popularity with Trump supporters. Maybe we’ll even see the other “savior”, McConnell, as VP to make an even stronger GOP ticket.

It would take a general strike to get the attention of lawmakers. (and I'd like to see that but the left and right would have to realize that on many issues they are on the same side just coming at it from opposite directions)

ah6gxc,Megathread: President Trump Directed His Attorney To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project,politics,84478,1547783814.0,post
eebvd80,"#UPDATE: **Mueller has gone on the record to deny the characterization of Cohen's testimony**. Here is their statement:

>""BuzzFeed's' description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate.""

My reading of legal expert consensus on twitter is that BuzzFeed's law enforcement sources were likely not prosecutors (and certainly not Mueller's office), and were over-stating the conclusiveness with which documentary evidence demonstrated Trump's ""direction"" of specific perjury. This is only relevant to the first quoted section of the my comment below (which is unaltered).

----------------------------

Since I put a lot of work into this, copying from the original thread:

This is a cover-up of a deal Trump was negotiating not with ""Russian businessmen"", but **directly with the Kremlin**, and was worth more than the last 20 years of Trump Org building projects combined.

>Now the two [federal law enforcement officials] have told BuzzFeed News that Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, **the president personally instructed him to lie** — by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did — in order to obscure Trump’s involvement.

[This was a felony to which Michael Cohen has already pled guilty](https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/Politics/michael-cohen-expected-plead-guilty-lying-congress-collusion/story?id=59491450), and they aren't just taking Cohen's word for it that Trump directed the crime. They appear to have a lot of evidence:

>""The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through...**internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.""**

This is called suborning false statements, and constitutes Obstruction of Justice, **according to none other that current Attorney General nominee William Barr**, as directly stated [in his infamous memo to DoJ and Trump's lawyers](https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/1086095561722347520) that likely won him the job in the first place:

>Thus, for example, if a President knowingly destroys or alters evidence, **suborns perjury, or induces a witness to change testimony...then he, like anyone else commits the crime of obstruction**


He reconfirmed this in his confirmation hearing just yesterday. [At the 2:27:02 Mark](https://www.c-span.org/video/?456626-1/attorney-general-nominee-william-barr-confirmation-hearing#&start=8840):

>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. In your memo, you talked about the Comey decision, and you talk about Obstruction of Justice and you already went over that which I appreciate. You wrote on Page One **A President persuading a person to commit perjury would be obstruction.** Is that right?
>
>BARR: **Yes.** Well, any person who persuades another to, yeah --
>
>KLOBUCHAR: Okay. You also said that a President or any person **convincing a witness to change testimony would be Obstruction.** Is that right?
>
>BARR: **Yes.**

And then at [05:23:30](https://www.c-span.org/video/?456626-1/attorney-general-nominee-william-barr-confirmation-hearing#&start=16295), None other than folksy Senator **Lindsey Graham** made sure to hammer it home:

>Lindsey Graham: Thank you. I'll just take a couple seconds to see if I can help clarify this. Because I think it's been a very interesting hearing. **So if there was some reason to believe that the president tried to coach somebody not to testify or testify falsely, that could be obstruction of justice.**

This is the first evidence in the public sphere of Trump directly being involved in the cover-up while President. Any and all chance of plausible deniability just flew out the window.

Plus, this also implicates Donnie Jr. and Ivanka as well in the cover-up. Junior coordinated his story with the other witnesses, and several other staffers like Hope Hicks all testified to Congress the same stuff that Cohen testified to. If Cohen, who has a history of keeping all of his emails and recording all of his conversations, pointed the Special Counselor to it among the millions of documents the FBI seized from him, then everyone is going down for being part of the conspiracy.

Also, if we're getting this from Cromier and Leopold, then not only did it happen, but it's far enough along that it can't be stopped. Anthony Cromier won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism, and Jason Leopold is a finalist for 2018. They uncovered the details behind Paul Manafort's money laundering, how the Russians hid payments, uncovered the screwiness at the Treasury where several people were potentially working with Russian spies, and they broke open the details of the Trump Tower Moscow deal last month. Also, Cromier worked on uncovering the Stormy Daniels payoff made by Michael Cohen. These dudes are ballers.

It also shows how involved the family was!

> Ivanka Trump was slated to manage a spa at the tower and personally recommended an architect.

Cohen rebuffed the athlete’s proposal, which angered Ivanka Trump, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News.

> A spokesperson for Ivanka Trump's attorney wrote that she was only “minimally involved” in the project. “Ms. Trump did not know about this proposal until after a non-binding letter of intent had been signed, never talked to anyone outside the Organization about the proposal, never visited the prospective project site and, even internally, was only minimally involved,” wrote Peter Mirijanian.",politics,50,1547789197.0,comment

And Roberts, while conservative, extremely values his legacy as Chief Justice and the integrity of the Supreme Court. I doubt that he would run the trial unfairly.
